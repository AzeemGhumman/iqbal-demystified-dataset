O Himalah! O rampart of the realm of India!
Bowing down, the sky kisses your forehead
Your condition does not show any signs of old age
You are young in the midst of day and night's alternation
The Kalam of tur Sana witnessed but one Effulgence
For the discerning eye you are an embodiment of Effulgence
To the outward eye you are a mere mountain range
In reality you are our sentinel, you are India's rampart
You are the diwan whose opening verse is the sky
You lead Man to the solitudes of his heart's retreat
Snow has endowed you with the turban of honour
Which scoffs at the crown of the world-illuminating sun
Antiquity is but a moment of your bygone age
Dark clouds are encamped in your valleys
Your peaks are matching with the pleiades in elegance
Though you are standing on earth your abode is sky's expanse
The stream in your flank is a fast flowing mirror
For which the breeze is working like a kerchief
The mountain top's lightning has given a whip
In the hands of cloud for the ambling horse
O Himalah! Are you like a theater stage
Which nature's hand has made for its elements?
Ah! How the cloud is swaying in excessive joy
The cloud like an unchained elephant is speeding
Gentle movement of the morning zephyr is acting like a cradle
Every flower bud is swinging with intoxication of existence
The flower bud's silence with the petal's tongue is saying
"I have never experienced the jerk of the florist's hand
Silence itself is relating the tale of mine
The corner of nature's solitude is the abode of mine"
The brook is melodiously descending from the high land
Putting the waves of Kawthar and Tasnam to embarrassment
As if showing the mirror to Nature's beauty
Now evading now rowing against the rock in its way
Play in passing this orchestra of beautiful music
O wayfarer! The heart comprehends your music
When the night's Lailah unfurls her long hair
The sound of water-falls allures the heart
That silence of the night whose beauty surpasses speech
That state of silent meditation overshadowing the trees
That dusk's beauty which shivers along the mountain range
Very beautiful looks this rouge on your cheeks
O Himalah! Do relate to us some stories of the time
When your valleys became abode of Man's ancestors
Relate something of the life without sophistication
Which had not been stained by the rouge of sophistication
O Imagination! Bring back that period
O Vicissitudes of Time speed backwards
You are not familiar with the hardships of solving enigmas
O Beautiful Rose! Perhaps you do not have sublime feelings in your heart
Though you adorn the assembly yet do not participate in its struggles
In life's assembly I am not endowed with this comfort
In this garden I am the complete orchestra of Longing
And your life is devoid of the warmth of that Longing
To pluck you from the branch is not my custom
This sight is not different from the sight of the eye which can only see the appearances
Ah! O colorful rose this hand is not one of a tormentor
How can I explain to you that I am not a flower picker
I am not concerned with intricacies of the philosophic eye
Like a lover I see you through the nightingale's eye
In spite of innumerable tongues you have chosen silence
What is the secret which is concealed in your bosom?
Like me you are also a leaf from the garden of tur
Far from the garden I am, far from the garden you are
You are content but scattered like fragrance I am
Wounded by the sword of love for search I am
This perturbation of mine a means for fulfillment could be
This torment a source of my intellectual illumination could be
This very frailty of mine the means of strength could be
This mirror of mine envy of the cup of Jam could be
This constant search is a world-illuminating candle
And teaches to the steed of human intellect its gait
The earth and sky were unknown worlds to me
Only the expanse of mother's bosom was a world to me
Every movement was a symbol of life's pleasure to me
My own speech was like a meaningless word to me
During infancy's pain if somebody made me cry
The noise of the door chain would comfort me
Oh! How I stared at the moon for long hours
Staring at its silent journey among broken clouds
I would ask repeatedly about its mountains and plains
And how surprised would I be at that prudent lie
My eye was devoted to seeing, my lip was prone to speak
My heart was no less than inquisitiveness personified
Through you the secret was revealed to the human intellect
That innumerable enigmas are solved by human intellect
You were the complete soul, literary assembly was your body
You adorned as well as remained veiled from the assembly
Your eye is longing to witness that veiled Beauty
Which is veiled in everything as the pathos of life
The assemblage of existence is rich with your harp
As mountain's silence by the brook's melodious harp
The garden of your imagination bestows glory on the universe
From the field of your thought worlds grow like meadows
Life is concealed in the humor of your verse
Picture's lips move with your command of language
Speech is very proud of the elegance of your miraculous lips
Thurayyah is astonished at your style's elegance
Beloved of literature itself loves your style
Delhi's bud is mocking at the rose of Shiraz
Ah! You are resting in the midst of Delhi’s ruins
Your counterpart is resting in the Weimar's garden
Matching you in literary elegance is not possible
Till maturity of thought and imagination are combined
Ah! What has befallen the land of India!
Ah! The inspirer of the super-critical eye!
The lock of Urdu's hair still craves for combing
This candle still craves for moth's heart-felt pathos
O Jahanabad ! O cradle of learning and art
Your entire super-structure is a silent lament
The sun and the moon are asleep in every speck of your dust
Though innumerable other gems are also hidden in your dust
Does another world-famous person like him also lie buried in you?
Does another gem like him also lie concealed in you?
Elevation bestows the sky's nearness to my abode
I am the mountain's cloud, my skirt sprinkles roses
Now the wilderness, now the rose garden is my abode
City and wilderness are mine, ocean is mine, forest is mine
If I want to return to some valley for the night
The mountain's verdure is my carpet of velvet
Nature has taught me to be a pearl spreader
To chant the camel song for the camel of the Beloved of Mercy
To be the comforter of the dispirited farmer's heart
To be the elegance of the assembly of the garden's trees
I spread out over the face of the earth like the locks
I get arranged and adorned by the breeze's
I tantalize the expecting eye from a distance
As I pass silently over some habitation
As I approach strolling towards a brook's bank
I endow the brook with ear rings of whirlpools
I am the hope of the freshly grown field's verdure
I am the ocean's offspring, I am nourished by the sun
I gave ocean's tumult to the mountain spring
I charmed the birds into thrilling chants
I pronounced "Rise" standing by the verdure's head
I conferred the taste for smile to the rose-bud
By my benevolence farmers' huts on the mountain side
Are converted into bed chambers of the opulent
One day a spider said to a fly
"Though you pass this way daily
My hut has never been honored by you
By making a chance visit inside by you
Though depriving strangers of a visit does not matter
Evading the near and dear ones does not look good
My house will be honored by a visit by you
A ladder is before you if you decide to step in
Hearing this the fly said to the spider,
"Sire, you should entice some simpleton thus
This fly would never be pulled into your net
Whoever climbed your net could never step down"
The spider said, "How strange, you consider me a cheat
I have never seen a simpleton like you in the world
I only wanted to entertain you
I had no personal gain in view
You have come flying from some unknown distant place
Resting for a while in my house would not harm you
Many things in this house are worth your seeing
Though apparently a humble hut you are seeing
Dainty drapes are hanging from the doors
And I have decorated the walls with mirrors
Beddings are available for guests’ comforts
Not to everyone’s lot do fall these comforts".
The fly said, "All this may very well be
But do not expect me to enter your house
"May God protect me from these soft beds
Once asleep in them getting up again is impossible"
The spider spoke to itself on hearing this talk
"How to trap it? This wretched fellow is clever
Many desires are fulfilled with flattery in the world
All in the world are enslaved with flattery"
Thinking this the spider spoke to the fly thus!
"Madam, God has bestowed great honors on you!
Everyone loves your beautiful face
Even if someone sees you for the first time
Your eyes look like clusters of glittering diamonds
God has adorned your beautiful head with a plume
This beauty, this dress, this elegance, this neatness!
And all this is very much enhanced by singing in flight".
The fly was touched by this flattery
And spoke, "I do not fear you any more
I hate the habit of declining requests
Disappointing somebody is bad indeed"
Saying this it flew from its place
When it got close the spider snapped it
The spider had been starving for many days
The fly provided a good leisurely meal
A mountain was saying this to a squirrel
"Commit suicide if you have self-respect
You are insignificant, still so arrogant, how strange!
You are neither wise, nor intelligent! not even shrewd!
It is strange when the insignificant pose as important!
When the stupid ones like you pose as intelligent!
You are no match in comparison with my splendor
Even the earth is low compared with my splendor
The grandeur of mine does not fall to your lot
The poor animal cannot equal the great mountain!"
On hearing this the squirrel said, "Hold your tongue!
These are immature thoughts, expel them from your heart!
I do not care if I am not large like you!
You are not a pretty little thing like me
Everything shows the Omni-potence of God
Some large, some small, is the wisdom of God
He has created you large in the world
And He has taught me climbing large trees
You are unable to walk a single step
Only large size! What other greatness have you?
If you are large show me some of the skills I have
Show me how you break this beetle nut as I can
Nothing is useless in this world
Nothing is bad in God's creation
There was a verdant pasture somewhere
Whose land was the very picture of beauty
How can the beauty of that elegance be described
Brooks of sparkling water were running on every side
Many were the pomegranate trees
And so were the shady pipal trees
Cool breeze flowed everywhere
Birds were singing everywhere
A goat arrived at a brook's bank from somewhere
It came browsing from somewhere in the nearby land
As she stopped and looked around
She noticed a cow standing by
The goat first presented her compliments to the cow
Then respectfully started this conversation
"How are you! Madam Cow"?
The cow replied, "Not too well
"My life is a mere existence
My life is a complete agony
My life is in danger, what can I say?
My luck is bad, what can I say?
I am surprised at the state of affairs
I am cursing the evil people
The poor ones like us are powerless
Misfortunes surround the ones like us
None should nicely deal with Man
May God protect us from Man!
He murmurs if my milk declines
He sells me if my weight declines
He subdues us with cleverness!
Alluring, he always subjugates us!
I nurse his children with milk
I give them new life with milk
My goodness is repaid with evil
My prayer to God is for mercy!"
Having heard the cow's story like this
The goat replied, "This complaint is unjust
Though truth is always bitter
I shall speak what is fair
This pasture, and this cool breeze
This green grass and this shade
Such comforts, were beyond our lot!
They were a far cry for us speechless poor!
We owe these pleasures to Man
We owe all our happiness to Man
We derive all our prosperity from him
What is better for us, freedom or bondage to him?
Hundreds of dangers lurk in the wilderness
May God protect us from the wilderness!
We are heavily indebted to him
Unjust is our complaint against him
If you appreciate the life's comforts
You would never complain against Man"
Hearing all this the cow felt embarrassed
She was sorry for complaining against Man
She mused over the good and the bad
And thoughtfully she said this
"Small though is the body of the goat
Convincing is the advice of the goat!"
My longing comes to my lips as supplication of mine
O God! May like the candle be the life of mine!
May the world's darkness disappear through the life of mine!
May every place light up with the sparkling light of mine!
May my homeland through me attain elegance
As the garden through flowers attains elegance
May my life like that of the moth be, O Lord!
May I love the lamp of knowledge, O Lord!
May supportive of the poor my life's way be
May loving the old, the suffering my way be
O God! Protect me from the evil ways
Show me the path leading to the good ways
Perched on the branch of a tree
Was a nightingale sad and lonely
"The night has drawn near", He was thinking
"I passed the day in flying around and feeding
How can I reach up to the nest
Darkness has enveloped everything"?
Hearing the nightingale wailing thus
A glow-worm lurking nearby spoke thus
"With my heart and soul ready to help I am
Though only an insignificant insect I am
Never mind if the night is dark
I shall shed light if the way is dark
God has bestowed a torch on me
He has given a shining lamp to me
The good in the world only those are
Ready to be useful to others who are
As I slept one night I saw this dream
Which further increased my vexation
I dreamt I was going somewhere on the way
Dark it was and impossible to find the way
Trembling all over with fear I was
Difficult to take even a step with fear was
With some courage as I forward moved
I saw some boys as lined in nice array
Dressed in emerald-like raiment they were
Carrying lighted lamps in their hands they were
They were going quietly behind each other
No one knew where they were to go
Involved in this thought was I
When in this troupe my son saw I
He was walking at the back, and was not walking fast
The lamp he had in his hand was not lighted
Recognizing him I said "O My dear!
Where have you come leaving me there?
Restless due to separation I am
Weeping every day for ever I am
You did not care even a little for me
What loyalty you showed, you left me"!
As the child saw the distress in me
He replied thus, turning around to me
"The separation from me makes you cry
Not least little good does this to me"
He remained quiet for a while after talking
Showing me the lamp then he started talking
"Do you understand what happened to this?
Your tears have extinguished this"!
I am constantly reminded of the bygone times
Those garden's springs, those chorus of chimes
Gone are the freedoms of our own nests
Where we could come and go at our own pleasure
My heart aches the moment I think
Of the buds' smile at the dew's tears
That beautiful figure, that Kamini’s form
Which source of happiness in my nest did form
I do not hear those lovely sounds in my cage now
May it happen that my freedom be in my own hands now!
How unfortunate I am, tantalized for my abode I am
My companions are in the home-land, in the prison I am
Spring has arrived, the flower buds are laughing
On my misfortune in this dark house I am wailing
O God, To whom should I relate my tale of woe?
I fear lest I die in this cage with this woe!
Since separation from the garden the condition of my heart is such
My heart is waxing the grief, my grief is waxing the heart
O Listeners, considering this music do not be happy
This call is the wailing of my wounded heart
O the one who confined me make me free
A silent prisoner I am, earn my blessings free
The bright sun is hidden, the night shows its face
The night's hair is spread on shoulders of the earth
This black dress is preparation for some one's mourning
Perhaps the Nature's assemblage for the sun is mourning
The sky is casting a spell over the talking lip
The night's magician is watching the awakened eye
The wind current is submerged in the river of silence
However, the tolling bell's sound comes from the distance
Heart which in love's turmoil is evading the world
Has dragged me here far from the maddening crowd
I am the spectator of the spectacle of disappointments
I am the associate of those sleeping in solitude's corner
O My restlessness! Wait and let me rest awhile
And let me shed a few tears at this habitation
O those steeped in a swoon, "Where are you?
Tell me something of the land where you live
Is that world also one of prevarication?
Is that world also one of denizens' struggle?
Is Man engulfed by sorrow in that land also?
Is Man's heart suppressed and helpless in that land also?
Does the moth burn itself in candle's love in that land also?
Does the tale of flower and nightingale exist in that garden also?
In this world a single hemistich perturbs the heart
Does there also the warmth of verse soften the heart?
This world's relations and alliances life's woes are
Are similar sharp thorns present in that garden also?
The daily bread and a million calamities this world has
Does the soul freedom from anxieties in that world has?
Are the thunder, the farmer, the harvest there also?
Are the caravan and the robber's fear there also?
Do birds collect bits of straw for nests there also?
Is the search for bricks and clay for house there also?
Are the humans unaware of their reality there also?
Are they after nations' and customs' discrimination there also
Does garden not cry at the nightingale's wail there also?
Like this world is there no sympathy in that world also?
Does the Paradise a garden or a restful mansion constitute?
Or does the Eternal Beauty's Unveiled Face it constitute ?
Does hell a method of burning away sins constitute?
Or it in flames of fire a way of discipline constitute?
Has walking given way to speedy flying in that world?
What is the secret of what is called death by denizens of this world?
Life eases the heart's restlessness in this world
Is human knowledge also restricted in that world?
Does the separated heart get satisfaction by sight there also?
Are "Lan Tarana" saying the turs of that land also
Does the soul get solace in longing there also?
Is man a victim of desire to learn there also ?
Ah! Is that land also filled with darkness?
Or with Love's light is completely illuminated?
Tell us what the secret under this rotating dome is
Death a pricking sharp thorn in the human breast is
O Candle! Why does the moth love you?
Why is this restless soul devoted to you?
Your charm keeps it restless like mercury
Did you teach it the etiquette of Love?
It circumambulates the site of your manifestation
Is it inspired with the fire of your lightning?
Do the woes of death give it the peace of life?
Does your flame possess the quality of eternal life?
If you do not brighten this sorrowful world
This burning heart's tree of Longing may not green up
Falling before you is the prayer of this little heart
The taste for impassioned Love knows this little heart
It has some zeal of the Primeval Beauty's Lover
You are a small tur it is a small Kalam
The moth and the taste for the Sight of the Light!
This small insect and the Longing for the Light!
One day Intellect said to the heart
"A guide to the misguided ones I am
Being on the earth I reach up to the sky
Look, how deep in comprehension I am
Guidance on earth is my sole occupation
Like the auspicious Khizr in character I am
Interpreter of the book of life I am
The Manifestation of God's Glory I am
You are only a drop of blood, but
The invaluable ruby's envy I am"
Hearing this the heart said, "All this is true
But look at me as well, what I am
You understand the secrets of life
But seeing them with my own eyes I am
Concerned with the manifest order you are
And acquainted with the inward I am
Learning is from you, but Divine Knowledge is from me
You only seek Divinity, but showing Divinity I am
Restlessness is the end of Knowledge
But the remedy for that malady I am
You are the candle of the assembly of Truth
The lamp of the Divine Beauty's assemblage I am
You are related to time and space
The bird recognizing the Sidrah I am
Look at the grandeur of my station
The throne of the God of Majesty I am
Consumed with grief I am, I get relief in no way
O circumambient waters of the Ganges drown me
Our land foments excessive mutual enmity
What unity ! Our closeness harbors separation
Enmity instead of sincerity is outrageous
Enmity among the same barn’s grains is outrageous
If the brotherly breeze has not entered in a garden
No pleasure can be derived from songs in that garden
Though I exceedingly love the real closeness
I am upset by the mixing of waves and the shore
The miraculous poet is like the grain from the barn
The grain has no existence if there is no barn
How can beauty unveil itself if no one is anxious for sight
Lighting of the candle is meaningless if there is no assembly
Why does the taste for speech not change to silence
Why does this brilliance not appear out from my mirror
Alas! My tongue poured its speech down
When war’s fire had burnt the garden down
O Sun! The world's essence and motivator you are
The organizer of the book of the world you are
The splendor of existence has been created by you
The verdure of the garden of existence depends on you
The spectacle of elements is maintained by you
The exigency of life in all is maintained by you
Your appearance confers stability on everything
Your illumination and concord is completion of life
You are the sun which establishes light in the world
Which establishes heart, intellect, essence and wisdom
O Sun! Bestow on us the light of wisdom
Bestow your luster's light on the intellect's eye
You are the decorator of necessaries of existence' assemblage
You are the Yazdan of the denizens of the high and the low
Your excellence is reflected from every living thing
The mountain range also shows your elegance
You are the sustainer of the life of all
You are the king of the light's children
There is no beginning and no end of yours
Free of limits of time is the light of yours
O Candle! I am also an afflicted person in the world assembly
Constant complaint is my lot in the manner of the rue
Love gave the warmth of internal pathos to you
It made me the florist selling blood-mixed tears
Whether you be the candle of a celebrating assembly or one at the grave
In every condition associated with the tears of sorrow you remain
Your eye views all with equity like the Secret's Lovers
My eye is the pride of the tumult of discrimination
Your illumination is alike in the Ka‘bah and the temple
I am entangled in the temple and the Haram's discrimination
Your black smoke contains the sigh's elegance
Is some heart hidden in the place of your manifestation?
You burn with pathos due to distance from Tajalli’s Light
Your pathos the callous ones consider your light
Though you are burning you are unaware of it all
You see but do not encompass the internal pathos
I quiver like mercury with the excitement of vexation
As well I am aware of vexations of the restless heart
This was also the elegance of some Beloved
Which gave me perception of my own pathos
This cognition of mine keeps me restless
Innumerable fire temples are asleep in this spark
Discrimination between high and low is created by this alone!
Fragrance in flower, ecstasy in wine is created by this alone!
Garden, nightingale, flower, fragrance this Cognition is
Root of the struggle of 'I and you' this Cognition is
At creation's dawn as Beauty became the abode of Love
The sound of "Kun" taught warmth to the spirit of Love
The command came Beauty of Kun's garden to witness
With one eye a thousand dreadful dreams to witness
Do not ask me of the nature of the veil of being
The eve of separation was the dawn of my being
Gone are the days when unaware of imprisonment I was
That my abode the adornment of the tree of tur was
I am a prisoner but consider the cage to be a garden
This exile’s hovel of sorrow I consider the homeland
Memories of the homeland a needless melancholy became
Now the desire for sight, now Longing for search became
O Candle ! Look at the excessive illusion of thought
Look at the end of the one worshipped by celestial denizens
Theme of separation I am, the exalted one I am
Design of the Will of the Universe’s Lord I am
He desired my display as He designed me
When at the head of Existence’ Diwan He wrote me
The pearl likes living in a handful of dust
Style may be dull the subject is excellent
Not seeing it rightly is the fault of short-sighted perception
The universe is the show of effulgence of taste for Cognizance
This network of time and space is the scaling ladder of the Universe
It is the necklace of the neck of Eternal Beauty
I have lost the way, Longing for the goal I am
O Candle ! Captive of perception’s illusion I am
I am the hunter as well as the circle of tyranny’s net !
I am the Haram’s roof as well as the bird on Haram’s roof
Am I the Beauty or head to foot the melting love am I ?
It is not clear whether the beloved or the Lover am I ?
I am afraid the old secret may come up to my lips again
Lest story of suffering on the Cross may come up again
O Lord ! I have become weary of human assemblages!
When the heart is sad no pleasure in assemblages can be
I seek escape from tumult, my heart desires
The silence which speech may ardently love!
I vehemently desire silence, I strongly long that
A small hut in the mountain's side may there be
Freed from worry I may live in retirement
Freed from the cares of the world I may be
Birds' chirping may give the pleasure of the lyre
In the spring's noise may the orchestra's melody be
The flower bud bursting may give God's message to me
Showing the whole world to me this small wine-cup may be
My arm may be my pillow, and the green grass my bed be
Putting the congregation to shame my solitude's quality be
The nightingale be so familiar with my face that
Her little heart harboring no fear from me may be
Avenues of green trees standing on both sides be
The spring's clear water providing a beautiful picture be
The view of the mountain range may be so beautiful
To see it the waves of water again and again rising be
The verdure may be asleep in the lap of the earth
Water running through the bushes may glistening be
Again and again the flowered boughs touching the water be
As if some beauty looking at itself in mirror be
When the sun apply myrtle to the evening's bride
The tunic of every flower may pinkish golden be
When night's travellers falter behind with fatigue
Their only hope my broken earthenware lamp may be
May the lightning lead them to my hut
When clouds hovering over the whole sky be .
The early dawn's cuckoo, that morning's mu’adhdhin
May my confidante he be, and may his confidante I be
May I not be obligated to the temple or to the mosque
May the hut’s hole alone herald of morning’s arrival be
When the dew may come to perform the flowers’ ablution
May wailing my supplication, weeping my ablution be
In this silence may my heart’s wailing rise so high
That for stars’ caravan the clarion’s call my wailing be
May every compassionate heart weeping with me be
Perhaps it may awaken those who may unconscious be
Far from the ignoble strife of Man's tavern you are
The wine-cup adorning the sky's assemblage you are
The jewel which should be the pearl of the morning's bride's ear you are
The ornament which would be the pride of horizon's forehead you are
The blot of night's ink from time's page has been removed!
The star from sky like a spurious picture has been removed!
When from the roof of the sky your beauty appears
Effect of sleep's wine suddenly from eyes disappears
Perception's expanse gets filled with light
Though opens only the material eye your light
The spectacle which the eyes seek is desired
The effulgence which would open the insight is desired
The desires for freedom were not fulfilled in this life
We remained imprisoned in chains of dependence all life
The high and the low are alike for your eye
I too have longing for such a discerning eye
May my eye shedding tears in sympathy for others' woes be!
May my heart free from the prejudice of nation and customs be!
May my tongue be not bound with discrimination of color
May mankind be my nation, the whole world my country be
May secret of Nature's organization clear to my insight be
May smoke of my imagination's candle rising to the sky be
May search for secrets of opposites not make me restless!
May the Love-creating Beauty in everything appear to me!
If the rose petals get damaged by the breeze
May its pain dropping from my eye as a tear be
May the heart contain that little spark of Love's fire
The light of which may contain the secret of the Truth
May my heart not mine but the Beloved's mirror be!
May no thought in my mind except human sympathy be!
If you cannot endure the hardships of the tumultuous world
O the Great Luminary that is not the mark of greatness!
As you are not aware of your world-decorating beauty
You cannot be equal to a speck of dust at the Man's door!
The light of Man eager for the Spectacle ever remained
And you obligated to the tomorrow's morning ever remained
Longing for the Light of the Truth is only in our hearts
Abode of Lailah of desire for search is only in this litter
Opening of the difficult knot, Oh what a pleasure it is!
The pleasure of universal gain in our endless effort is!
Your bosom is unacquainted with the pain of investigation
You are not familiar with searching of the secrets of Nature
O Pathos of Love! You are a glossy pearl
Beware, you should not appear among strangers
The theatre of your display is concealed under the veil
The modern audience' eye accepts only the visible display
New breeze has arrived in the Existence' garden
O Pathos of Love! Now there is no pleasure in display
Beware! You should not be striving for ostentation!
You should not be obligated to the nightingale's lament!
The tulip's wine-cup should be devoid of wine
The dew's tear should be a mere drop of water
Your secret should be hidden in the bosom somewhere
Your heart -melting tear should not be your betrayer
The flowery-styled poet's tongue should not be talking
Separation's complaint should not be concealed in flute's music
This age is a critic, go and somewhere conceal yourself
In the heart in which you are residing conceal yourself
The learning's surprise is neglecting you, beware!
Your immature eye is not the seeker of Truth, beware
Let the elegant thought remain in search of Truth
Let your wisdom-loving eye remain in astonishment
This is not the garden whose spring you may be
This is not the audience worthy of your appearance
This audience is the lover of the material sights
The purpose of your sight is the closet of secrecy
Every heart is intoxicated with the wine of thinking
Something different is the tur of the Kalams of this age
O withered rose! How can I still call you a rose?
How can I call you the longing of nightingale's heart?
Once the zephyr's movement was your rocking cradle
In the garden's expanse joyous rose was your name
The morning breeze acknowledged your benevolence
The garden was like perfumer's tray by your presence
My weeping eye sheds dew on you
My desolate heart is concealed in your sorrow
You are a tiny picture of my destruction
You are the interpretation of my life's dream
Like a flute to my reed-brake I narrate my story
Listen O rose! I complain about separations!
O you whose life is confined in the material world
O you whose soul is imprisoned in the cage
Look at the freedom of this garden's warblers
Look at the prosperity of those once desolate
This is the congregation with which I was concerned
This is the reward of patience and perseverance
My tomb-stone is ardently desirous of speech, look !
At this tomb-stone's inscription with insight look !
If your aim in the world is dan's education
Never teach your nation world's abdication
Do not use your tongue for sectarianism
Resurrection Day's tumult for booty is stalking
Your writings should pave the way for unity
Beware! No heart should be hurt by your speech
In the new congregation do not start old tales
Do not start again what are now unacceptable tales
Listen to my advice if you are any statesman
Courage is your support if you are a leader of men
Hesitation in expressing your purpose does not behoove you
If your intentions are good you should not fear anything
The Mu’min's heart is clear of fear and hypocrisy
The Mu’min's heart is fearless against the ruler's power
If your hands do hold the miraculous pen
If your heart's cup is clear like the cup of Jam
You are a Divine pupil! Keep your tongue immaculate!
Beware, Lest your prayer's call remains unanswered!
With the miracle of your verse awaken those sleeping
Burn down falsehood's produce with the flame of your call
The sun's boat is broken and drowned in the Nile
But a piece is floating about on the water of the Nile
The twilight's pure blood drips into the sky's basin
Has the lancet of Nature drawn the sun's blood ?
Has the sky stolen the ear ring of the evening's bride?
Or has the fragile cord in the Nile's waters strolling?
Your caravan is afoot without help of bell's call
The human ear cannot hear your foot-steps' sound
You show the spectacle of rise and fall to the eyes
Where is your home? To which country are you going?
O star-like planet take me with yourself
The prick of Longing's thorn keeps me restless
I am seeking light, I am weary in this habitation
I am the restless child in the existence's school
As I looked at the bright sun in the morning
I asked the assemblage of Existence' habitation
"You owe your light to the reflection of the sun
The water of your rivers looks like flowing silver
The sun has adorned your face with light's jewelry
This very candle has illuminated your assemblage
Your roses and rose gardens are pictures of Paradise
All these are the commentaries of Surah "Wa al- Shams"
The dress of your flowers is red, of your trees is green
They exist in your garden like green and red fairies
The frill of your tent becomes golden
As the red clouds appear over the horizon
How pleasing to the eye is the red color of the evening's twilight
As if you have poured rose-colored wine in the evening's jar
Your rank is elegant, your grandeur is high
Everything yours is concealed in the light's veil
The morning head to foot is a song of your majesty
Not even a trace of darkness is there under the sun
In this habitation of light is my abode also
Why then is the star of my destiny burnt down?
I am far from light and imprisoned in darkness
Why am I so unfortunate, unlucky and sinning"?
As I was saying this a voice from somewhere came
From the sky's roof or the earth's expanse it came
"My existence is dependent on your light
Your personality is the gardener of Universe' garden
You are the assemblage of beauty, your picture I am
You are the Scripture of Love, your commentary I am
You have put my disordered affairs in order
You have shouldered the burden which I could not bear
My existence depends upon the light of the sun
And your splendor is not indebted to the sun
Without the sun my rose garden would be desolate
Instead of happiness prison would be my name
Ah! The one who does not understand the open secret!
The one prone to be entangled in the desires' net
Alas insensible! Confined to the material is your eye
Naz behooved you, but prone to Niyaz is your eye
If aware of your reality you would be
Neither unlucky nor sinning you would be
When the sparkling of the night's forehead's decoration disappeared
The zephyr of life with the news of the happy morning appeared
It awakened the nightingale of flowery song in its nest
It shook the shoulder of the farmer on the field's edge
It broke the spell of darkness of night’s talisman with Surah al-Nur
It robbed the golden crown of bed-chamber's candle in the dark
It chanted the magic of awakening on those sleeping in the temple
It gave the Brahman the tidings of the bright sun
Arriving at the mosque's roof it said to the Mu’adhdhin
"Do you not fear appearance of the resplendent sun ?"
Climbing the garden's wall it cried this to the rose-bud
"Burst! You are the Mu'adhdhin of the morning O rose-bud"
It gave the command in the wilderness "Move O Caravan"!
"Every dust speck will shine like fire-fly in the wilderness"
When it reached the cemetery from the living's habitation
Witnessing the spectacle of the cemetery it spoke thus
"Remain lying in comfort still, come again shall I
Make the whole world sleep, wake you up shall I
The hour of the Universe' appearance was charming
The flower-bud of life was showering smiles
Here the golden crown, the sun was getting
There the moon its moon-light was getting
The dark gown to the night was being given
Training of brightness to stars was being given
The Existence's branch was getting leaves here
The bud of life was bursting out there
The angels were teaching weeping to the dew
For the first time the rose was laughing
They were conferring pathos on the poet's heart
Khuda for the wine of Bükhuda was pining
For the first time dark black clouds were appearing
As if some Houri of Paradise with open hair was standing
The earth was claiming elegance of the sky
The space was claiming to be boundless
In short so beautiful the sight was
That seeing it in itself a panorama was
The angels their flying powers were testing
Eternal lights from their foreheads were appearing
An angel called Love there was
Whose guidance everyone's hope was
The angel who the embodiment of restlessness was
Angel among angels and restless like mercury he was
He was going towards the Paradise for a stroll
He met death on its way by the destiny's roll
He asked death, "What is the name and work of yours?
I do not want to encounter the face of yours"
Hearing this said the angel of death
"My work is clear, I am the angel of death
I shatter the chattels of existence
I extinguish the spark of life
The magic of annihilation is in my eyes
The message of destruction is its symhol
But there is one entity in the Universe
It is fire, I am only mercury before it
It lives in the human heart as a spark
It is the darling of the Divine Light
It constantly drips as tears from the eyes
The tears whose bitterness is tolerable"
When Love heard this from the death's lips ,
Laughter started appearing from its lips
The thunder of such smile descended on death
How can darkness stay in front of such light?
On seeing eternity to death it fell
Death it was, to death it fell
I am only relating to you the story of a mawlava
I have no intention of showing my smartness
His pious nature was widely known
All the high and low respected him
He used to say that Shara‘ah was veiled in tasawwuf
As meanings were veiled within words
His heart's flask was filled to the brim with piety's wine
He also had lees of the thought of pantology at the bottom
He often used to describe his supernatural powers
He always intended increase of his disciples' numbers
He had been living in my neighborhood since long
The ascetic and the rind were mutual friends since long
The dignitary asked a friend of mine one day
"Iqbal who is a dignitary in the field of literature
How is he in the obedience to the rules of Shara‘ah ?
Though in poetry he is envy of the Kalam of Hamadan
I hear he does not consider the Hindu a non-believer
He has such beliefs as a result of philosophy
He has accepted a little bit of Shiaism also
I have heard the greatness of ‘Ala from him
He considers music as part of adoration
He aims at making a mockery of religion
He does not feel shy with amorous people
This is a very old habit of our poets
He has music at night, Qur’an's recitation in the morning
This secret is not yet fully understood by me
But the information obtained from my disciples is
That spotless like the dawn's whiteness his youth is
He is not Iqbal but a strange mixture of opposites he is
Treasure of wisdom is his heart, but enigmatic his temper is
He knows spiritual freedom as well as the Shara‘ah
Regarding tasawwuf, he is second only to Mansur
I am unable to understand his reality
Founder of another kind of Islam he appears to be"
In short he prolonged his sermon very much
He long continued this wonderful speech
Everyone soon hears all happenings in this city
I myself heard it through my friends in the city
One day as the respected ascetic met me in the street
The old story restarted during the talk in the street
He said, "That accusation was due to my affection
It was my duty to show you the path of the Shara‘ah"
I said, "I have no intention of any complaint at all
It was your right due to being my neighbor
I bow my head respectfully before you
My youth is accustomed to respect for the old
If you do not know the reality about me
It does not show any lack of pantology
I myself do not know my reality
Very deep is the sea of my thoughts
Since long I am also longing to see Iqbal
For long I have shed tears in his separation
Iqbal also is not acquainted with Iqbal
There is no joke in it, by God he is not
A nation is the body, people are its organs
Artisans are the nation's hands and feet
The State administration is the nation's beautiful face
The elegant-styled poet is the nation's clear-sighted eye
When any organ is afflicted with pain, the eye weeps
How sympathetic to the world body is the eye
Tales of gallows and crucifixion are mere child's play for the Heart
The request of Arina is only the title of the story of the Heart
O Lord! How powerful the full cup of that wine would be?
The Way to eternity is each single line on the measuring cup of the Heart
O Lord! Was it the cloud of mercy or the thunderbolt of Love
When the life's crop got burned down, sprouted the seed of the Heart
You would have got the Beauty's bountiful treasure
O Farhad ! You never dug into the ruins of the Heart
Now it looks like the ‘ ‘Arsh ’, now like the Ka'bah
O God! Whose lodging is the abode of my Heart
It has its own junun4 and I have my own sawda
The Heart loves someone else and I love the Heart
You do not comprehend this, O simple hearted ascetic!
Envy of a thousand prostrations is one slip of the Heart
It changes the heap of earth into elixir
Such is the power of the ashes of the Heart
It gains freedom after being caught in the net of Love
On being thunder-struck greens up the tree of the Heart
My impatient heart keeps me relentlessly restless
Like mercury agitation is the essence of life to me
Wave is my name, the sea is fordable to me
The whirlpool's circle would never be a chain to me
My steed speeds in the water like wind
The fishing tackle has never caught my skirt
Sometimes I jump up due to attraction of the full moon
Sometimes in excitement I strike my head on the shore
I am the traveller who loves destination
Someone should ask me why I always jump
Fleeing from the discomfort of the narrow river I am
Upset by separation from the ocean's vastness I am
Farewell O worldly companions! I am going to my homeland
I am feeling unhappy in this well‑populated wilderness
I am very much dejected, unsuitable for assemblies I am
Neither you are suitable for me nor suitable for you I am
The king's audience and the minister's bed-chamber each is a prison
The golden chain's prisoner will break himself free from this prison
Though much pleasure is in embellishing your assembly
But some kind of strangeness is in your acquaintance
I remained long in company of your self‑centered people
I remain restless for long like the waves of the ocean
I remained long in your luxury gatherings
I remained long searching for light in the darkness
I searched long for the rose' sight among thorns
Ah! I have not found that Yusuf in your market place
The perplexed eye for another scene is searching
As storm-stricken my eye for coast is searching
Leaving your garden like fragrance I am going
Farewell ! O worldly company I am going to the homeland
I have made my home in the quietness of the mountain side
Ah! I do not get this pleasure in conversation's music!
Associate of Nargis-i-Shahlah , and rose's companion I am
The garden is my homeland, nightingale's associate I am
The sound of the spring's music lulls me to sleep
The morning cuckoo from the green carpet wakes me up
Everyone in the world assemblage social life likes
The poet's heart but the solitude's corner likes
I am verged on lunacy by being perturbed in habitations
For whom I am searching, roaming in the mountain valleys?
Whose love makes me roam in the meadows?
And makes me sleep on the spring's banks?
You taunt me that fond of the corner of retirement I am
Look O imprudent one! Messenger of Nature's assembly I am
Compatriot of the elms, turtle‑dove's confidante I am!
In this garden's silence in the state of anxiety I am!
If I do hear something it is only to tell others
If I do see something it is only to show others
My heart is a lover of retirement, proud of my home I am
Scoffing at the thrones of Dara and Sikandar I am
How enchanting is the act of lying under the trees
As now and then my sight falls at the evening star
Where in the strange house of learning can this be seen!
The secret of universe can only in the rose‑petal be seen
You scream as I snatch away the knife from you
Do you consider me unkind though I am kind to you?
O Newcomer of this sorrowful land, you will scream
Beware! The pen's point is sharp, the prick may hurt you
Ah! Why fond of the troublesome things are you?
This piece of paper is harmless, play with it
Where is your ball? Where is your China cat?
Where is that small animal with broken head?
Your mirror had been free of want's dust cloud
With eye's opening has been flashed the want's spark
In your hand's movement, in your looks is hidden
Your want also is newly born just like you
Your life is free of the discretion's restrictions
But the secret of Nature is displayed in your eyes
When being annoyed at something with me you scream
What is the matter a mere scrap of paper you accept
Ah! In this habit I am also concordant with you
You love fidgetiness and I also love fidgetiness
I am the lover of ephemeral pleasures, I cry
I soon become angry, I soon calm down
My eyes are attracted by apparent beauty
My ignorance is no less than your ignorance
I am also now crying now laughing like you
Outwardly I am elderly, I am also simply a baby
My story is not indebted to the patience of being heard
My silence is my talk, my speechlessness is my speech
Why does this custom of silencing exist in your assembly?
My tongue is tantalized to talk in this assembly
Some leaves were picked up by the tulip, some by the narcissus,some by the rose
My story is scattered around everywhere in the garden
The turtle-doves, parrots, and nightingales pilfered away
The garden's denizens jointly robbed away my plaintive way
O Candle! Drip like tears from the eye of the moth
Head to foot pathos I am, full of longing is my story
O God! What is the pleasure of living so in this world?
Neither the eternal life, nor the sudden death is mine
This is not only my wailing, but is that of the entire garden
I am a rose, to me every rose' autumn is my autumn
"In this grief-stricken land, in life-long spell of the caravan's bell I am
From the palpitating heart's bounties the silent clamor I have "
In the world's garden unaware of pleasant company I am
Whom happiness still mourns, that hapless person I am
Speech itself sheds tears at my ill luck
Silent word, longing for an eager ear I am
I am a mere handful of scattered dust but I do not know
Whether Alexander or a mirror or just dust and scum I am
Despite all this my existence is the Divine Purpose
Embodiment of light is whose reality, that darkness I am
I am a treasure, concealed in the wilderness dust
No one knows where I am, or whose wealth I am?
My insight is not obligated to the stroll of existence
That small world I am whose sovereign myself I am
Neither wine, nor cup-bearer, nor ecstasy, nor goblet I am
But the truth of everything in the existence' tavern I am
My heart’s mirror shows me both world’s secrets
I relate exactly what I witness before my eyes
I am bestowed with such speech among the elegant speakers
That the birds of the ‘Arsh’s roof are concordant with me
This also is an effect of my tumultuous love
That my heart’s mirrors are Destiny’s confidante
Your spectacle makes me shed tears, O India !
Your tales are admonitory among all the tales
Conferring the wailing on me is like conferring everything
Since eternity Destiny’s pen has put me where all your mourners are
O gardener do not leave even the rose-petals’ trace in this garden !
By your misfortune war preparations are afoot among the gardeners
The sky has kept thunderbolts concealed up its sleeve
Garden’s nightingales should not slumber in their nests
Listen to my call, O imprudent one ! This is something which
The birds in gardens are reciting like the daily prayers
Think of the homeland, O ignorant one ! Hard times are coming
Conspiracies for your destruction are afoot in the heavens
Pay attention to what is happening and what is going to happen
What good there is in repeating the tales of the old glories ?
How long will you remain silent ? Create taste for complaint !
You should be on the earth, so your cries be in the heavens !
You will be annihilated if you do not understand, O people of India!
Even your tales will disappear from the world’s chronicles
This is the law of Nature, this is the order of Nature
Those who tread dynamism’s path, are the darlings of Nature
I will surely exhibit all my hidden wounds today
I will surely change assembly to a garden with blood-mixed tears
I have to light every heart’s candle with hidden pathos
I will surely create bright illumination in your darkness
So that love-cognizant hearts be created like rose-buds
I will surely scatter around my handful of dust in the garden
If stringing these scattered pearls in a single rosary
Is difficult, I will surely make this difficult task easy
O Companion! Leave me alone in the soul-searching effort
As I will surely exhibit this mark of the ardent Love
I will show the world what my eyes have seen
I will surely make you also bewildered like a mirror
The discerning eye sees every thing covered in veils
It does see the exigencies of the nature of times
You have not acquainted your heart with pleasure of dignity
You have passed your entire life in humility like foot-prints
You always remained entangled inside the assembly, but
Have not acquainted yourself with the world outside the assembly
You have continued loving the charm of material beauties
But you have never seen your own elegance in this mirror
Give up prejudice O imprudent one! In the world's glass house
They are your own pictures which you have taken as evil ones
Become embodiment of the wail of tyranny of life's pathos!
You have concealed sound in your pocket like the rue seed
Clarity of heart has nothing to do with external decorations
O imprudent one! You have applied myrtle to mirror's palm
Not only the earth even the sky is bewailing your imprudence
It is outrageous that you have twisted the Qur'an's lines!
To what purpose is your claim to monotheism!
You have made the idol of self conceit your deity
What did you see even if you saw Yusuf in the well?
O imprudent one! You have made the Absolute confined
You are greedy of flowery style even at the pulpit
Your advice also is a form of story telling
Show that universally illuminating Beauty to your weeping eye
Which renders the moth highly agitated, which makes the dew weep like eye
Mere seeing is not its purpose! O greedy one
Some One has made the human eye with some purpose
Even if he viewed the whole world, what did he see?
Jam could not see his own reality in the wine cup
Sectarianism is the tree, prejudice is its fruit
This fruit caused expulsion of S Adam from Paradise
Not even a single rose-petal could rise by sun's attraction
It is the longing for elegance which raises the dew
Those wounded by Love do not wander in search of cure
These wounded ones themselves create their own cure
The heart gets complete illumination by the spark of Love
The tur's flower bed is raised from the Love's small seed
Every malady's cure is to remain wounded with Longing's sword
Wound's remedy is to remain free from obligation to stitching
With the Bekhuda's wine up to the celestial world is my flight
From disappearance of color I have learnt to remain fragrance
How can the weeping eye refrain from homeland's lamentation?
The ‘ibadah for the poet's eye is to remain constantly with ablution
To what purpose should we make our nest in the rose-branch
Ah ! How can we live with constant disgrace in the garden
If you understand, independence is veiled in Love
Slavery is to remain imprisoned in the net of schism
Contentment is what keeps the cup submerged in water
You should also remain like the bubble in the stream
It is best for you not to remain indifferent to yours own
O apathetic person! If you want to remain alive in the world
Soul-invigorating wine is the Love of the human race
It has taught me to remain ecstatic without the wine cup and the pitcher
Sick nations have been cured only through Love
Nations have warded off their adversity through Love
The expanse of Love is at once foreign land and homeland
This wilderness is the cage, the nest, as well as the garden
Love is the only stage which is the stage as well as the wilderness
It is the bell, the caravan, the leader as well as the robber
Everybody calls it an illness, but it is such an illness
In which the cure for all ills and misfortunes is concealed
The heart's pathos in a way is to become embodiment of Light
If this moth burns it is also the assembly's candle
The Beauty is just one but appears in everything
It is Sharan, the sky, as well as the mountain digger
Distinction of sects and governments has destroyed nations
Is there any concern for the homeland in my compatriot's hearts?
Prolonging the tale of my woes calls for silence, otherwise
The tongue in my mouth as well as the ability to speak is
"Take not this meaningful tale as related by me is
The story was endless, but related with silence is"
O house! Your resident is now residing in the West
Ah! The land of the East was not liked by him
Today my heart is convinced of this truth
The light of the separation's day is darker than night
"As from his departure's breast the scar is picked up
Sight is asleep in my eyes like the extinguished candle"
I am fond of seclusion, I hate the habitation
I run away from the city in excruciation of love
I make the heart restless from the olden days' memory
For satisfaction I come ardently running towards you
Though the eye is familiar with your nook and corner
Still some strangeness is apparent from my speed
My heart's speck was just to be acquainted with the sun
The broken mirror was just to expand into the universe
The tree of my longings was just going to green up
Ah ! what does any one know what I was going to be!
Mercy's cloud gathered up its skirt from my garden and departed
Rained a little over the flower buds of my desires and departed
Where are you! O Kalam of the pinnacle Sana of learning!
Your breath was the breeze promoting the joy of learning
Gone is that zeal for walking in the vast expanse of learning!
In my intellect also you were the inspirer of love of learning
"Where is Lailah's fervor, so as to decorate Love again
May make the dust of Majnun mixed with wilderness again
The wilderness of solitude will open the fate's knot
I shall reach you after breaking the chains of the Punjab
The bewildered eye looks upon your picture
But how can one searching for speech be happy?
"No power to speak the picture's mouth has
Silence is the speech which the picture has"
Though miles away from my abode is your homeland
Tumultuous like the sea is my heart with your attraction
Where do you intend to go? From where are you coming?
Perhaps you have become pale from the journey's hardships
In creation you are embodiment of light, of darkness I am
In spite of this misfortune akin to you in destiny I am
Ah! Ablaze I am from the heat of longing for God's Sight
Embodiment of pathos are you from obligation of sun's sight
If your motion established in an orbit is
My motion also like that of a compass is.
You are diligently pursuing your life's path, so am I
You are lighted in existence' assembly, so alight am I
In the midst of my journey I am, in the midst of your journey you are
Similar to the silence of my heart, silent in your assembly you are
A seeker you are and the same custom is mine
Moon light is your light, Love is the light mine
In the world of my residence with an assembly I also am
If unique in your assembly you are, unique like you I am
The light of the sun as the message of death to you is
Annihilated in the Eternal Beauty's effulgence my heart is
Still, O shining moon! I am different, you are different
The bosoms which are afflicted by the pathos are different
Though the embodiment of darkness I am, embodiment of light you are
Hundreds of stages away from the taste of Intellect you are
I know what the purpose of my existence is
This is the luster of which your forehead devoid is
As the star of your destiny ascended to shine
It lifted and brought you from Abyssinia to Hijaz
This alone made inhabited your desolate house
Better than a thousand freedoms is your slavery
That threshold not even for a moment you could leave
In some one's Love all torments you bore cheerfully
The oppression befalling in Love is not oppression
If there is no torment, there is no pleasure in Love
Full of Intellection like Salman was your insight
The wine of sight used to increase your thirst
Like Kalam you were in search of the Sight
Uwais was tantalized for the power of Sight
Madinah was the light for your eyes so to say
For you this wilderness was the tur so to say
Your longing for Sight continued even after witnessing the Sight
The cold heart warmed up but its breath did not rest even for a moment
Such a lightning struck your impatient soul
That your darkness was scoffing at the Musa's palm
"They captured warmth from the flame and struck it on your heart
What a lightning of Effulgence they struck on motes of your efforts!"
The charm of your longing for the Sight was the embodiment of supplication
The continuous sighting of someone was your prayer
Since eternity the Adhan was the anthem of your Love
Prayer was the subtle pretext for the Sight
Happy was the age when Yathrib was his abode!
How happy was the time when common was his Sight
Someone should hear the tale of my emigration
I ignored the story of the primeval covenant
I did not feel attachment to the garden of Paradise
When I drank the fiery cup of Intellection
I remained in pursuit of the Truth of the universe
I exhibited the excellence of elegant thoughts
I got such a change-loving temperament
That I did not settle anywhere under the sky
Sometimes I removed the stone idols from the Ka'bah
Sometimes I established the idols in the Haram
Sometimes I arrived at tur in my desire to speak
And I concealed the Eternal Light up my sleeve
Sometimes I was nailed to the cross by my own clan
I rose to the Celestial world leaving the earth
Sometimes I remained hidden in Cave of Hira for years
Sometimes I gave the world the last cup of Divine wine
Coming to India I played the Divine Orchestra
Sometimes I chose the land of Greece
When the people of India paid no heed to my call
I populated the countries of China and Japan
Sometimes I created the universe by combining elements
I did this against the meanings of priests' preaching
I stained hundreds of lands with blood
When I started the war between Intellect and religion
When I could not understand the reality of stars
I passed sleepless nights in this contemplation
The swords of the Church could not frighten me
When I taught the theory of earth's revolution
I demonstrated the gravity's secret to the world
Using the far-sighted Intellect's mirror
I arrested radiations and the restless electricity
I made the earth the source of envy to Paradise
Ah! But I could not reach the Existence' secrets
Though I made the world beautiful with my Intellect
In the end as my materialistic eye opened
I found Him lodged in my own heart
Better than the whole world is this India of ours
We are its nightingales, it is the garden of ours
If we are in foreign lands our hearts think of the homeland
Consider us present where this heart of ours is present
The highest mountain, touching the sky
It is our sentinel, it is our watchman
Thousands of rivers are playing in its lap are playing
Which make this garden of ours to be the world’s envy
O, The River Ganga’s waters ! Do you remember the day
When our caravan landed at your banks
Religion does not teach hostility with each other
We are Indians, India is our homeland
Greece, Egypt, Rome are all extinct from the world
But our renown and fame have continued so far
There is some secret that our existence is not effaced
For centuries time's vicissitudes have been our foe
Iqbal! In the world there is no confidante of ours
How would anyone know the hidden pathos of ours
The fire-fly's light is shining in the garden's abode
Or a candle is lighted in the assembly of flowers ?
Has some star flown down from the sky?
Or has a moon's ray been brought to life?
Or the emissary of the day has come to the night's kingdom?
Has become prosperous in foreign land was unknown in homeland
Has some button fallen from the cloak of the moon?
Or some speck has become prominent in the sun's shirt?
Was it the concealed glimpse of the Eternal Beauty?
Which was brought by Nature out of solitude into the assembly
Darkness as well as light is in this little moon
Now it is out of eclipse, now it is in eclipse
The moth is an insect, as the fire-fly is an insect
The former needs light, the latter is light's embodiment
Nature gave beauty to everything in the universe
It gave agitation to moth, it gave light to fire-fly
It gave flowery music to the speechless bird
Having given tongue to the rose taught it to be silent
The beauty of twilight's spectacle was decaying
Brightening up this fairy, a short life it gave
It gave color to the dawn like a beautiful bride
Clothing it in red dress gave it the mirror of dew
It gave shade to the tree, gave flight to the wind
It gave flow to water, gave restlessness to waves
This distinction but is a way of our thinking
The fire-fly's day is the same as our night
The Eternal Beauty's reflection is present in everything
It is speech in man. It is blooming in the flower bud
This moon in the sky is the poet's heart so to say
It is moonlight there what here the prick of pathos is
The manners of speech have deceived us, otherwise
Song is nightingale's fragrance, flower's fragrance is its song
Concealed in plurality is the secret of the Unity
What is fire-fly’s brightness is flower’s fragrance
Why should this difference be occasion for dissensions?
When the Primeval Day’s silence be concealed in everything
Should I abandon the pleasure of sun's and moon's company?
And should I abandon this service of conveying dawn's message
For me the height of the world of stars is not good
For me lowliness of earth's denizens is better than this height
What is the sky? Is the uninhabited homeland of mine
The tattered skirt of the morning is my shroud
My destiny is dying and being born every day
Drinking morning draft of wine from the hand of death's cup-bearer
This service, this honor, this elegance is not good
Darkness is better than this ephemeral illumination
If I had the power, I would have never become a planet
I would have become the shining pearl in the ocean's depth
There also if I would have become weary of the waves' struggle
Leaving the ocean I would have become some neck's decoration
The pleasure of brightness is in being some beauty's ornament
In being the ornament of the crown of the princess of Caesar
As the fortune of a piece of stone gained ascendancy
It did not stop short of being jewel of Sulaiman's ring
But breaking is the end of such things in the world
Breaking is the end of the invaluable pearls
Real life is the one which is not acquainted with death
What good is the life in which there is demand of death?
If this is the end of being the decoration of the universe
Why should I not fall as dew on some flower?
I should live as shining specks in the decoration of someone's forehead
I should live in the sparks of some oppressed person's sighs
As tear I be entangled in the eye lashes of someone
Why should I not drip from the eyes of that lady?
Whose husband, clad in the chains‑armor is departing
To battlefield, compelled by the love of the homeland
Who may be exhibiting hope and despair's spectacle
Whose silence may be putting speech to embarrassment
To whom pleasing the husband may give the strength for patience
And to whose eyes' modesty may give the power to speak
Whose rosy cheeks at departure's time may be turned pale
Attraction of whose beauty by separation's sorrow may be enhanced
However hard she may control but still I may drip
I may spill over from the cup of the tearful eye
After mixing with dust I may get eternal life
And departing, I may show warmth of Love to the world
The land in which Chishta delivered the message of God
The garden in which Nanak sang the song of Tawhad of God
The land which the Tatars adopted as their homeland
For which people of Hijaz abandoned the Arabian wilderness
That same is my homeland, that same is my homeland
Whose wisdom had left the Greeks bewildered
Which gave knowledge and skill to the entire world
Whose soil had been endowed by God with the elixir's effect
Which had filled the pocket of the Turks with diamonds
That same is my homeland, that same is my homeland
Which illuminated and established in the milky way again
The stars which had fallen from the sky of Persia
The House from which the world had heard Tawhad's tune
From where the Holy Prophet had felt cool breeze
That same is my homeland, that same is my homeland
Whose denizens are Kalams , whose mountains the Sinais are
Where the Prophet Nuh's boat and its occupants had landed
The land whose elegance is the stairway to the sky
Living in whose environment is like living in Paradise
That same is my homeland, that same is my homeland
May I tell the truth O Brahman! If it does not displease you
The idols of your temple have become anachronistic
You have learnt grudge with your own people from the idols
God also has taught fighting to Muslim preachers
Becoming tired, I finally abandoned the temple and the Haram
I abandoned the preacher's sermons, as well as your stories
You take the stone idols to contain God
Every speck of the homeland's dust is holy to me
Come! Let us again roll up the curtains of strangeness
Let us unite the separated ones, let us remove the disunion
The heart's habitation is lying barren since long
Let us build a new temple in this country
Let our shrine be higher than the world's shrines
Let us make its spire as high as the sky
Let our morning's incantations be so sweet every morning
That all worshipers be ecstatic with the Love's wine
The power and tranquillity is in the devotees' song
The salvation of the denizens of the earth is in Love
The grandeur of Ghalib1 has remained buried since long
Mahdi Majruh1 is the cemetery's resident since long
Death broke the decanter of Amir in a strange country
The assembly's eye still has the ecstasy of the wine of Amir
However, today O Companion! The whole garden is mourning!
Lighted candle is extinguished, literary assembly is mourning!
The Delhi's nightingale made its nest in such a garden
Where all the world's nightingales are singing in a chorus
Ah Dagh has gone! His bier is on our shoulders
The last poet of Jahanabad is finally silent
Gone is that smartness! Gone is that humor of style!
The fire of youth was veiled in the old age's camphor
Every heart has the longing which the language of Dagh had
This Lailah was unveiled there, she is behind the veil here
Who will ask zephyr now the secret of silence of the rose?
Who in the garden will understand the secret of nightingale's wailing?
In his elegant imagination he was not unaware of reality
The bird's eye remained focused on the nest even in flight
Others will show us the subtleties of linguistic thought
The elevated elegance of the sagacity of their thought
They will make us cry painting the picture of time's vicissitudes
Or will show us the new world of their imagination
Nightingales of Shiraz also will be born in this garden
There will be hundreds of magicians and masters of miracles
Thousands of Azars will rise from the temple of poetry
The new cup-bearers will serve wine from the new goblets
Many commentaries of the book of Love will be written
There will be many interpretations of the youths' dreams
However, who will draw the exact picture of Love?
The master having departed who will enchant the heart
I am sowing the seeds of tears in the soil of verse
You also cry, O Delhi's soil! I am crying for Dagh!
Ah! O The Ka'bah of the literateur's religion
Your garden has been ruined by autumn today
That colorful rose of yours has departed like fragrance
That is, the abode of Urdu has become deprived of Dagh
Perhaps not much attraction was in the homeland's soil
That full moon has set in the soil of the Dakkan
The cup-bearers have left, the tavern has become deserted,
Only Hala the memorable personality of Delhi's assembly has been left
The tyranny of death makes longing shed tears of blood
The archer of death shoots out arrows in the dark
However, the tongue cannot open in complaint
Autumn's style is also a prelude to garden's existence
The one universal law creates all such results
Exit of fragrance from the garden, that of the gardener from the world
Today dark clouds have appeared from the east again
Mount Sarban has become covered with darkness again
As the sun's face became hidden under the clouds
Cool breeze also came riding on the steed of clouds
There are no thunder claps, silent are these clouds
Strange in its tranquillity is this tavern of dark clouds
It has brought everlasting joy's message for the garden
It has come to stitch pearls to the jacket of rose
The flowers which were fading by sun's heat freshened up
Those which were sleeping in the earth's bosom woke up
With the wind's force the cloud rose, advanced and flowed
Some dark clouds rose up, the clouds burst open into rain!
The camp of the mountains' trees is wonderful
Strollers in valleys should stay among its trees
Early in the evening a song bird
Sitting on a branch was singing
It saw a glowing object on the ground
Considering it a fire‑fly flew down to it
The fire-fly said to the singing bird
"O singing bird, do not kill a helpless creature,
Who gave chirping to you, and fragrance to the rose
The same God gave the glittering light to me
I am clad in the apparel of light
I am the tur of the insects' world
If your chirping is the ear's pleasure
My brightness also is the sight's pleasure
Nature has given light to my wings
It has given fascinating voice to you
He taught singing to your beak
He made me the torch of the garden
He bestowed glitter upon me, voice upon you
Conferred warmth upon me and music upon you
Warmth is not the opposite of music
Everywhere warmth is the associate of music
The assembly of existence is based on these alone
All the world's manifestations are through these alone
The world's assembly is based on harmony alone
The bloom of this garden is based on this alone"
O Child with moth-like nature , "How strange that
You keep gazing at the flame of the candle for hours
What is this movement, when you are in my lap?
Are you intending to embrace the light?
Though your tiny heart is surprised at this spectacle
But this is recognition of some object already seen!
The candle is but a flame, you are the Light embodied
Ah! In this assembly that is manifest, you are concealed
It is not known why the Nature's hand made it manifest!
And concealed you in the dark soil's mantle
Your light has been concealed under the veil of Intellect!
The veil of Cognition is a mere mist to the wise eye!
What is called life really a mirage it is
A dream, a swoon, an ecstasy, oblivion it is
The Nature's assembly is the Beauty's boundless ocean
For the discerning eye every drop is the Beauty's storm
Beauty is in the frightening silence of the mountain
In shedding of sun's light, and in night's darkness
It is in the morning sky's mirror-like glitter
In the night's darkness and in the twilight's floridity
It is in the disappearing relics of the old magnificence
In the small child's effort to commence speaking
It is in the harmony of the denizens of the rose-garden
In the nest-building efforts of the tiny little birds
In the mountain stream, in the ocean's freedom is Beauty
In the city, the forest, the wilderness, the habitation is Beauty
The soul but longing for some lost object is
Or else why is it lamenting in wilderness like a bell ?
It is restless even in this general splendor of Beauty
Its life is like a fish out of water
In the evening's serenity the Rava melodious is
Do not ask me what the condition of my heart is
This became message of prostration’s rise and fall to me
The whole world became precincts of the Haram to me
I am standing at the bank of the running water
However, I do not know where I am standing
The red wine has colored the skirt of the evening
The aged sky is holding wine cup in its trembling hand
The day's fast moving caravan is advancing to its end
The evening's twilight is the sun's flower so to say
In the distance those solitary structures are standing
They are the minarets of the Mughal emperors' tombs
This place is the tale of revolution’s tyranny
This place is some book of the bygone age
This place is a silent orchestra so to say
Not trees ! But it is a serene assembly so to say
A fast moving boat is sailing on its surface
Whose sailor is fighting fiercely with the waves
This boat is in fast speed like the sight
Getting out of sight, it has gone far away
The ship of Man’s life is sailing in the same way
It is present as well as hidden in eternity’s sea
It never gets acquainted with defeat
It is concealed from sight but is not effaced !
What angels recite is your exalted name
Your threshold is exalted, your munificence is gerneral
The stars are stable by the attraction of your Love
Your system is like the system of the sun
The pilgrimage to your tomb is life for the heart
Your status is higher than those of Masih and Khidar
The Beloved’s Nature is veiled in your Love
High is your dignity, exalted is your veneration
If my heart has a stain the stain is of your love
But if cheerful I am, I am the rose of your spring
Leaving the garden I have come out like the rose of your fragrance
I am determined to go through the test of perseverance
I have started with zeal from the homeland’s tavern
The pleasure of the wine of knowledge is speeding me up
I am gazing at the mercy’s cloud, I am the wilderness tree
With the Mercy of God I am not in need of the gardener
May I be living elegantly in the world like the sun
May I be bestowed with that ladder by your blessings
May I be so far ahead of the fellow travelers
That I may be regarded as the destination by the caravan
May my pen not hurt anybody’s feelings
May I have complaint against none under the sun
Whose effect may penetrate the hearts like a comb
May I receive such a clamor from your threshold
The nest I had made by picking up bits and pieces
May I see the same nest in the garden again
May I come back to put my forehead at my parents’ feet
Whose efforts made me the confidante of love
That candle of the audience of the Holy Prophet’s descendants
Whose threshold I will always consider like the Haram
Whose breath opened the flower bud of my longing
By whose benevolence I became sagacious
Pray to the terrestrial and the celestial world’s Lord
That I may again become happy with paying homage to him
That second Yusuf to me, that candle of Love’s assembly
Whose brotherly love has given soul’s tranquillity to me
Who in his love, destroying the book of “you and I”
Has brought me up to my youth in the environment of happiness
May he remain happy in the world like rose
Whom I have always held dearer than my life
Blooming, my heart’s bud may become a flower!
May this traveler’s request be accepted!
Do not look at the garden of existence like a stranger
It is a thing worth looking at, look at it repeatedly
You have come into the world like a spark, beware
Lest your ephemeral life may end suddenly, beware
Granted that I am not worthy of your Sight
You should look at my zeal, and look at my perseverance
If your eyes have been opened by the longing for Sight
Look for the foot prints of the Beloved in every lane
If you had not come I would have had no occasion for contention
But what reluctance in making the promise was?
Your messenger disclosed every secret
O Lord! What fault of Man in this was?
You recognized Your Lover in the full assembly
How alert Your eye in the middle of the ecstasy was!
True! Reluctant he was to come, O messenger
But tell me what the manner of denial was
Musa was effortlessly attracted to Tur
How strong, O Zeal your attraction was !
Your fame continues somewhere, O Iqbal!
Some magic, not your speech it was
O Lord! Strange is the piety of the preacher
He has animosity towards the whole world
Nobody has so far understood that Man
Where he is going, and from where he has come?
From the same source has the night obtained darkness
From where the star has obtained brightness
The tale of our compassion is
Always related by our sympathizer
Very subtle are the ways of the preacher
He trembles on hearing the sound of adhan !
I should procure such straws for my nest from somewhere
For burning which the lightning may be restless
Alas! O despair! The sky broke it down intently
Whichever branch I selected for my nest
You are contending with the seventy two nations
One goblet of yours suits the whole world best
I should create some such longing in my heart
So the sky may turn around to annihilate me best
Collect your harvest first by picking it grain by grain
Some thunderbolt will surely come out to annihilate it
I had regard for the failure of the hunter, O friend
Otherwise, why could I come over flying for one grain ?
The heart should not sing freedom's song in this garden
Ah! This garden is not suitable for such odes !
What can I say how I got separated from my garden
And how I got imprisoned in the net of greed
It is strange that the whole world being against me
How the recipient of honor of respectability I have been
Some demand of showing and seeing was on the Tur
What do you know, O heart! How it was decided?
The desire to be without any desire is also a desire
How the heart's bird freed from the net of greed was
Those desirous of seeing You, see You here also
Then how the Last Day's promise a test of patience was
The Perfect Beauty itself may be the cause of this unveiling
How became self-apparent what concealed in curtains was
Death as a recipe still remains, O separation's pathos!
The physician is insane, how I deemed incurable was
O admonishing eye! Have you ever seen, how the rose
Having been born out of dust became colorful
The purpose of interrogation for deeds was to disgrace me
Otherwise all as to how and why it happened obvious was
My destruction was something worth witnessing
What can I say how l facing Him was
Unusual in state, distinct from the whole world they are
O Lord! Inhabitants of which habitation these Lovers are?
Even during pathos's cure I desperately love pathos
Blisters' thorns have been extracted with needle's point
O Lord, the garden of my hopes may remain prosperous
I have raised these plants watering them with my blood
The stars' silence at night makes me weep
Strange my Love is, strange my Laments are
Do not ask me of the pleasure of remaining destitute
Hundreds of nests have been made and destroyed by me
Being a stranger to the journey's companion is not good
O spark! Wait, after all we are also going to disappear
Expectation for the houri has taught everything to the preacher
Only in appearance simple and straight forward these people are
Why should not my verses be dear to me, O Iqbal
These the painful laments of my heart are
One should not see the Spectacle with the material eye
If one wants to see Him he should open the insight's eye
His talking lip was death's message to Mansur
How can anybody dare to claim Someone's Love now
Close your eyes if you want taste for the Sight
The real Seeing is that one should not try to see Him
I am the extreme Love, Thou art the extreme Beauty
One should see me or witness Thy Spectacle
The Beloved's Beauty is the creator of excuse for Love's crime
One need not create a new excuse on the Day of Judgment
O Companion! It is not possible to close this zealous eye!
In what other manner should one try to witness Him
With what thought did Kalam become insistent on the tur?
One should request for the Sight if he has the power for the Sight
Even the eyebrow's movement is unwelcome to the Sight
With the eye of the narcissus should one see Thee
The pleasures of the Longings of Love will be manifest
If one has Longing like me for a few days
What should I say how much Longing for dejection I have
The elegance of my market is only up to the ardent desire for losing
I am the sot who himself becomes garden by the Wine’s Light
Rose’s love is only up to the departure of the unkind cup bearer
Hunter’s enhancement of garden’s beauty is till start of my melodies
As for the thunderbolts’ restlessness, it is up to my nest
I am that handful of dust, which is changed to wilderness by distress’ grace
Do not ask me of my span, it is from the earth to the sky
I am the bell, complaint is asleep in my whole nature
The silence of mine only is up to the caravan’s departure
With a tranquil heart create means of attaining your aims
Because the whirlpool’s knot is only up to the water’s flow
Silence is death in the garden of Love, O nightingale
This life is only up to observance of the wailing’s custom
In youth, there is Sight’s zeal as well as Longing’s pleasure
The happiness of our house is only up to the guest’s presence
Disgraced though I am in the whole world but, O ignorance
I understand that my Love is known only to my confidante
The one I was searching for on the earth and in heaven
Appeared residing in the recesses of my own heart
When the reality of the self became evident to my eyes
The house appeared among residents of my own heart
If it were somewhat familiar with taste of rubbing foreheads
The stone of Ka‘bah’s threshold would have joined the foreheads
O Majnun! Have you ever glanced at yourself
That like Lailah you are also sitting in the litter
The months of the union continue flying like moments
But the moments of separation linger for months!
O seaman, how will you protect me from being drowned
As those destined to drowning get drowned in the boats also
The one who concealed His Beauty from Kalam Allah
The same Beloved is manifest among beloveds
The breath of Lovers can light up the extinguished candle
O God! What is kept concealed in the breast of the Lovers?
Serve the faqars if you have the longing for Love
This pearl is not available in the treasures of kings
Do not ask of these Devotees, if you have faith, you should look at them
They have the illuminated palm up their sleeves
The unsightful eye for whose spectacle is tantalized
That elegance of congregation is in these very recluses
Burn the produce of your heart with some such spark
That the Last Day’s sun may also be among your gleaners
For Love search for some heart which would become mortified
This is the wine which is not kept in delicate wine glasses
The Beauty itself becomes the Lover of whose Beauty
O Heart! Does someone among the beautiful has that beauty?
Someone became highly excited at your grace of Ma‘arafna
Your rank remained among the most elegant of all the Lovers
Manifest Thyself and show them Thy Beauty some time
Talks have continued among the sagacious since long time
Silent, O Heart! Crying in the full assembly is not good
Decorum is the most important etiquette among the ways of Love
It is not possible for me to deem my critics bad
Because Iqbal, I am myself among my critics
Completion of your Love is what I desire
Look at my sincerity what little I desire
It may be oppression or the promise of unveiling
Something testing my perseverance I desire
May the pious be happy with this Paradise
Only to see your Countenance I desire
Though I am but a tiny little heart I am so bold
To hear the same "Lan tarana " I desire
O assembly’s companions! I am existing only for a few moments
I am the dawn’s candle, I am about to be extinguished
I have divulged the secret in the full assembly
I am very insolent, punishment I desire
When that Beniaz opens His Graceful Hand
Why should the niazmand be not proud of his humility
You have confined Him to the ‘Arsh, O preacher !
What kind of God would keep away from His people?
In my view he is not a rind at all, O cup-bearer
Who would distinguish between ecstasy and lack of it
Always remain very attentive to the heart, this orchestra is such
If broken, it would produce the music of the Secret
Somebody should ask how it hurts the preacher
If God shows His Grace even to the sinner
O God! From where does poetry acquire its heat?
This is a thing with which even stone would soften
Nightingale’s lament comes from discrimination between tulip and rose
No one in the world should open the discriminating eye
The arrogance of piety has taught the preacher
To use abusive language to the people of God
Such wind should blow from India, O Iqbal
Which would blow me as dust to Hijaz
I bear hardships on myself, I am unconcerned with others
Alas! How strange, I am the oppressor, I am the ignorant
I existed only till the time Thy Splendor appeared
I am the falsehood which is annihilated by the Truth
From the knowledge’s sea divers came out with pearls in hand
Alas, O deprivation! A mere pebble collector on the sea shore I am
My disgrace itself is the demonstration of my nobility
I am the negligence which the angels ardently desire
O the existence’ assemblage! Be not proud of your beauty
You are a mere picture of the assemblage, I am the assemblage
O Iqbal! I am in constant search for myself
I am the traveler as well as the destination
Majnun abandoned habitation, you should abandon wilderness also
If there be ambition for Sight, you should abandon Lailah also
O preacher! Perfection of abandonment attains the objective
As you have abandoned the world, abandon the Hereafter also
Suicide is better than the way of taqlad
Seek your own path, abandon the love of Khizr also
Like the pen the un-Islamic message is on your tongue
Abandon unjustified pride in the un-Islamic objects also
Theology is no pleasure if heart does not have Love’s pathos
If you are not the Wounded, you should abandon fluttering also
Weep like the dew on flowers and leave the garden
Abandon the desire of staying in this garden also
The custom of Love is abandonment of all
Abandon temple, mosque, and church also
This is not business, this is ‘ibadat of God !
O ignorant one, abandon the longing for reward also
It is good to guard Intuition with Intellect
But sometimes you should let it go alone also
What life is that which is dependent on others ?
Abandon dependence on the life of fame also
Repeated request is a kind of boldness ! O Kalam
The condition for approbation is to abandon urging also
As the preacher brought proof in support of wine
Iqbal insists that he should abandon drinking also
The locks of the bride of night’s hair were still unbent
The sky’s stars were unacquainted with the taste of running
The moon in its new attire was looking a little strange
Was not familiar with the established laws of revolution
The earth had just emanated from possibility’s dark recesses
Life’s taste was still concealed from the expanse of space
Perfection of the order of existence was just starting
The gem’s longing was apparent from the ring’s eye
It is said that there was an alchemist in the spiritual world
The dust of whose feet was clearer than the Jam’s wine cup
A recipe for an Iksar was written on the leg of ‘Arsh
Which was hidden jealously by angels from Adam’s eye
But the alchemist’s attention was ever concentrated on it
He considered that recipe greater than Ism-i-A‘ïam
He advanced to the ‘Arsh under pretense of doxology
Inner longing was at last achieved by constant effort
He was roaming in the world in search of components
Nothing could be concealed from the knower of God’s Audience
He procured brightness from the star, spot from the moon
He stole a little darkness from the night’s uncombed hair
He obtained restlessness from thunder, chastity from Hur
He took warmth from the breath of Masah son of Maryam
Then he took a little grandeur of Beniyazi from the Divinity
He took humility from the angel, humbleness from dew’s destiny
Then dissolved these components in Chashmah-i-Haivan’s water
The compound was given the name of "Love" by the Grand ‘Arsh
The alchemist sprinkled this water at the newly created existence
With skill’s help he opened the knot of the world’s secrets
Movement appeared, the elements gave up sleep
Getting up each started embracing its companion
The suns and the stars learnt elegant movements
Flower buds learnt blooming poppies got their spots
Beauty one day put this question to God
Why did you not make me eternal in the world?
The answer was that the world is like a picture gallery
The world is the story of the long night of annihilation
As the nature of change is the basis of its display
Only that is beautiful whose reality is decline
The moon was somewhere near and it heard this conversation
It became well-known in the heaven, the morning star heard
Having heard from the star the morning related it to the dew
It exposed the celestial world’s secret to earth’s confidante
The flower’s eye started weeping from the dew’s message
The flower bud’s little heart was injured by this sorrow
The spring weeping from the garden departed
Youth had come for amusement, sad it departed
Love made you acquainted with the taste of affliction
Like assembly’s candle give affliction’s gift to the assembly
The illuminating Love depends on God’s Benevolence
To whomever He may give without restriction of temple or Haram
Like the candle the mantle of light he does not get
Whom God does not give effective wail in the world
He is in the star, the moon, the dawn’s theatre of display
You need not apply discrimination’s collyrium to the Sightful eye
Love is exalted above the customs and usages of prayers
If Beauty has ecstasy of elegance you too give elegant reply
O Tavern-keeper! Pleasure is the only effect of West’s wine
It does not have pleasure of affliction, give me the home-made wine
Do you not know? The old congregation has changed
For God’s sake do not give them materialism’s wine
O Impatient drop ! You are in the bosom of the sea
You were a pearl earlier, now you are an invaluable pearl
Ah! How gracefully you opened the secrets of life
I am still a prisoner of the discriminations of life
The life’s clamor on destruction became the Last Day’s tumult
The spark on being extinguished became Azar ‘ s fire temple
The denial of Existence is the Love’s gesture of the informed heart
In the river of La is concealed the pearl of Illallah
The meaning of the end is hidden from the unsightful eye
Mercury is only raw silver, when its restlessness stops,
The Ibraham of Love is the destroyer of the idol of existence
The ecstasy of Tasnam of Love is the cure of awareness
The message of others is different, my message is different
The style of address of the one afflicted with Love is different
You have heard the laments of the bird under the net
Also listen to the laments of the bird on the roof tops which are different
Call was coming from the mount, "Life’s secret is peace"
The frail ant was saying "The pleasure of struggle is different"
The glory of Hijaz’ assemblage is based on Haram’s Love
The station of this is different, the system of that is different!
Eternal luxury is death if there is no Longing for Search
Man’s revolving is different, wine-cup’s revolving is different
The dawn’s candle left the message that burning is life’s secret
In the life’s sorrowful abode the condition for eternity is different
The wine is still half-mature, Love is unsuccessful still
Leave the church’s brick on the pitcher’s mouth still
The dawn’s star was weeping and saying this
"I got the eye but not the leisure for Sight
Everything has come to life through the sun’s energy
Only I did not get protection under the morning’s skirt
After all what is the capacity of the dawn’s star
It is like bubble’s breath, like the spark’s brightness"
I said "O beautiful jewel of the dawn’ s forehead
Do you have fear of death? Come down from the sky
Drop down from the sky’s height with the dew
My poetry’s field will be invigorating to you
I am the gardener, Love is its bloom
Its foundation is firm like eternity
Just as the moon’s silver boat is drowned
In the storm of sun’s light at the break of dawn
Just as the moon-like lotus disappears
Behind the veil of light in the moon-lit night
Just like the Kalam’s radiant palm in the tur’s effulgence
And the flower bud’s fragrance in the wave of garden’s breeze
Similar is my heart in the flood of Thy Love
If Thou art the assembly, I am the assembly’s splendor
If Thou art the Beauty’s thunder, I am the produce of Love
If Thou art the dawn, my tears are Thy dew
If I am traveler’s night, Thou art my twilight
My heart harbors Thy disheveled hair locks
My bewilderment is created by Thy picture
Thy Beauty is Perfect, my Love is perfect
Thou art the spring’s breeze for my poetry’s garden
Thou gave tranquillity to my restless imagination
Since Thy Love took residence in my breast
New lights have been added to my mirror
Love’s nature gets stimulation for Perfection from Beauty
My hope’s trees flourished through Thy favor
Who has taught you this glancing with shyness?
Who has taught you the riddle of Love’s initiation?
Love comes out of each grace of yours
Wit is dripping from the blue eyes of yours
You see him sometimes, you shy away sometimes
Rise up sometimes, lie down and sleep sometimes
Is your eye bewildered like the mirror?
Are you recognized by the glow of knowledge?
You strike him with wrists, this is a strange playfulness!
Is it aversion or anger? Or a way of Love it is?
You will be removed from the lap if you will be naughty
You will be beaten if the flower on the breast will fall
What are you longing for? What are you seeking?
Ah! Are you also in Love with the same thing?
The feeling for Beauty is not special to Man
Like the heart it is present in everything
In the flask of time Love is like the pure wine
Love is the sun’s spirit, and the blood in moon’s veins
Its pain is concealed in every speck’s core
This is the light which is reflected in everything
It causes happiness somewhere, and sorrow somewhere
It is pearl somewhere, tear somewhere, dew somewhere
When the dawn uncovers its beautiful cheek
The flower bud uncovers its golden breast
It is manifest in the dawn's tavern
Its life is in the goblet of the sun
It opens up its heart before the sun
It enjoys the Love's anguish immensely
My sun ! You should also lift your veil some time
My restless eye is impatient to witness your sight
May the abode of your manifestations be in my heart
May your reflection flourish in the mirror of my breast
May your sight be the life for my heart
May your light be the cradle of my heart
May every speck of mine full of pleasure be again
May life's warmth appear again in the skill of my thoughts
May I view my sun's sight from the distance
May I embrace its light like a flower bud
May I highlight the reality of the restless life
May I also open the secret of heart 's thoughts
Being scared by the approaching dawn
Stars started saying to the moon
"The same scenes have continued in the sky
We became even tired of continuous shining
Our duty is moving morning till night
Moving, moving, continuously moving
Everything in this universe is restless
What is known as rest does not exist
Remain oppressed by the moving all
Stars, mankind, trees, rocks and all
Will this journey ever finish?
Will destination be ever visible?"
The moon started saying, "O Companions"!
"O gleaners of the field of night
In motion is the life of the universe
This is an age‑old custom of this place
The horse of time is ever running
Flogged by the desire for search
Resting on this path is inappropriate
Concealed in the rest's cloak is death
Those who were moving, have moved away!
Those halting a little, have been trampled!
The reward for this moving is Beauty
Love is the beginning, the end is Beauty
O Nightingale! The rose whose search made me flounced
By dint of good luck that rose I have finally found
I used to flounce myself, I used to make others flounced
I used to feel shy when I found you singing beautifully
A mere restless heart was not in my bosom, it was mercury
I was impatient for fulfillment of the Longing of Love
My misfortune was famous in the assembly of the rose
My morning was the reflection of my dark night
With my breath I have a blood‑stained knife in the bosom
Under the cloak of silence I have Judgment Day's uproar
Now that distress does not exist in my reflections' world
My reciting ghazals is no longer irksome to rose garden's assembly
With the heat of Love my blisters became flames
Now playing with thunderbolts are my wailings
The rouge of Love has changed this dark dust into a mirror
And I see the old companion's reflection in the mirror
By becoming a prisoner I gained my freedom
By ruining the heart I got prosperity for my house
My star is shining with this sun's light
By whose path's dust the moon light is shy
By a glance you taught me the rules of annihilation
How cool the day that has burnt away the motes from me
The one whose manifestation witnessed the astronomer's eye
In the sun, in the moon, in the assembly of stars
Whom the sufa found in the dark recesses of his heart
Whom the poet saw in the midst of elegance of Nature
Whose brilliance exists, whose fragrance persists
In the pearls of dew, in the shirts of flowers
Who has inhabited the wilderness by becoming tranquillity
Whose Presence creates the uproar in the midst of the garden
Though His Beauty is manifest in everything
In your eye is Its climax, O Sulaima!
(Part 1)
O Iqbal ! You are a strange mixture of opposites
You are the elegance of assembly’s crowd as well as alone
O lunatic with colorful song ! Your struggles and efforts
Are the garden’s beauty as well as wilderness’ adornment
You are the associate of stars due to your flight’s elegance
O land traveler your steps also traverse the sky
Your forehead is in prostration in the midst of preoccupation with wine
In your system are some colors of the system of goblets also
Like flower’s fragrance you are devoid of color’s dress
Though you are a creator of wisdom you are also insane
Like waves you are running to the destination without foot-prints
And then you are also left behind like the sea-shore
Female beauty has the effect of electricity for your nature
And strangely enough your loves are unconventional also
Your existence depends on the amusement’s law
Are you prostrating only at a single door step?
Among the beautiful you are famous for infidelity
O fickle-minded! You are famous as well as infamous
You have come into the world with mercury’s nature
Your restlessness is lovable, you are very restless
(Part-2)
What the disturbance of love has turned into wilderness
I keep that handful of dust concealed under the cloak
It has thousands of facets, each of a different color
I keep such a multi-faceted diamond in my breast
The poet’s heart, is but intoxication’s toil and hustle
What do you know, what I keep inside my breast!
In every intoxication of Love there is a new effulgence of Longing
I am restless, I have a heart unacquainted with rest
Though a new beauty every moment is the sight’s object
I have a firm covenant of fidelity with the Beauty
Beniaza has created my nature's Niaz
I keep the struggle for the Longing like the zephyr
The spectacle of a single flying spark
Cannot be assuasive as I have a thunderous heart
What may fulfill every demand of the nature of Love
Ah! Attainment of that Perfect Effulgence is my aim
The search for the Whole misguides me into It’s parts
The Beauty is boundless, I have the incurable pathos
My life depends upon Love's extreme compassion
But I keep the Love free of customs of fidelity
The truth is that lack of imagination produces fidelity
I have a new Resurrection Day ever fresh in my heart
Cup‑bearer's bounty is like dew, heart's capacity demands oceans
I am always thirsty, I have a burning fire under my foot
By creating me He created His own critic
As a picture, I have complaint against my Painter
If the Beauty was so short‑lived in existence' assembly
Why then do I keep such a boundless imagination?
I am constantly struggling in the Longing's wilderness
I am the ocean's wave, I carry my destruction on my shoulder
The dawn is vexed by separation from the sun
The twilight's eye is raining blood for the evening star
The day's Qais has the pining for the night's Lailah
The morning star is restless for perpetual radiance
The sky's polar star was saying to the stars' caravan
"Companions ! I am tantalized for the pleasure of walking"
Springs desire rivers, rivers love the ocean
The ocean wave is in love with the full moon
The eternal Beauty which is veiled in tulips and roses
Is considered to be restless for general manifestation
Ask Khizar of blessed steps for the secret of life
Everything is alive with un-achieved effort
My life is similar to that of the silent violin
The lap of which is full of all kinds of melodies
The harp of the universe is sacrificed on whose silence
Every string of which is the grave of hundreds of melodies
The silence of which is the custodian of music's perfection
And the silence of which is not obligated to any uproar
Ah ! The hope of my Love was never fulfilled
This instrument was never hit by the plectrum
But sometimes the zephyr of the garden of Tur flows
And sometimes the breeze of Houri’s breath from the sky
Which gently touches the string of my life
And frees the imprisoned soul of my life
The gentle sound of the music of despair rises
The clarion's call for the caravan of tears rises
Just as dew's elegance depends upon the taste for racing
The elegance of my nature depends upon grief's melodies !
You should not tell me, "Death is a message of luxury and pleasure"
You should not draw the picture of Sharab-i-tuhur's ecstasy ­
Do not feel grieved by separation from the Houri
Do not present the Houri in the mirror of words
Do not make me fascinated by the beautiful cup‑bearer
Do not describe the Houri, do not relate the Salsabal’s story
I do not doubt Paradise being the place of peace
Your message is not proper for the life's prime!
Ah! How long should youth linger in hope
Joy is not joy for which you remain waiting
What worth is the beauty which is in need of the discerning eye
Which is obligated for the tomorrow for its manifestation
Strange is the feeling for life
"Today's joy" is the belief of youth
What an ingenious tyranny of Nature it is!
Man has been made a seeker of the Secret
The Secret has been concealed from his eyes
The taste for awareness is restless
The secret of life is not un‑raveled
Amazing is the alpha and omega of life
What else is there in the mirror's house?
The river stream is moving fast
The river is moving towards the ocean
The wind is blowing the cloud
Is bringing the cloud on its shoulders
Stars are intoxicated with destiny's wine
They are chained in the prison of the sky
The sun, that early rising devotee
That carrier of the message of "rise"
Concealed in the hills of the west
Is drinking wine in twilight's goblet
Everything is enjoying its existence
It is intoxicated with manifestation's wine
None is sympathetic with Man!
Beauty's manifestation which gives restlessness to Longing
Which youth nurtures in its fancy's lap
By which this ephemeral universe becomes eternal
By which youth becomes a colorful tale
Which teaches us to be meditating
To be escaping the present state's scene
Which removes the immaturity of perceptions
Which makes Intellect a slave to impressions
Ah! Does that Beauty exist anywhere or not?
O Lord! Does that jewel exist on the universe' ring?
The moon's light is silent
The branches of every tree are silent
The songsters of the valley are silent
The green trees of the mountain are silent
Nature has become unconscious
It is sleeping in the night's lap
Some such spell of serenity exists
That Neckar's flow is also serene
The caravan of stars is silent
The caravan is moving without the bell
Silent are the mountains, forest, river
As if Nature is absorbed in deep meditation
O Heart! You should also become silent
Taking grief in your lap go to sleep
Why are you sad in the night's loneliness?
Are not the stars your close associates?
This elegant dignity of the silent sky
This sleeping earth, this silent world
This moon, wilderness, environment, mountains,
Nature is a prolific garden of white roses
The colorful pearls, are variegate and beautiful
Seem to be the stars of your tears
What do you desire so inordinately, O Heart!
Nature is in concord with you, O Heart!
Listen O seeker of heart's pathos ! I am Naz, you should become Niaz
I am the Ghaznavi of heart's Somnath, you completely become Ayaz
Greatness in the world is not associated with the Alexander’s splendor
Your breast has everything, you should also become the maker of mirrors
The aim of life's struggle is perfection of your Crescent's grandeur
You are the world's oldest Divine Command, be fulfilled like prayer
Be not contented, O gardener, your dignity is established by this alone
If flowers abound in the garden, you should become a more ardent beggar
Gone are those days, these are not the times for wandering in wilderness
Become melted in the world like the congregation's lighted candle
The individual's existence is unreal, the nation's existence is real
Be devoted to the nation, become destroyer of the unreal's magic
Iqbal ! These sectarians of India are working like Azar
Saving your skirt from idols become the dust of the way of Hijaz
I am wandering in search of a secluded corner
I have taken refuge at this mountain's side
Attraction of springs in their broken songs is excellent
Like the infant's supplication, who is learning to speak
The evening stars are established on the throne of twilight's rubies
The spectacle of the evening's beauty is Paradise for the observant's eye
Silence of separation's evening was an excuse to me
Someone's memory taught singing of this ode to me
This is the state of my impatient soul
I am like the small baby who is left alone
He starts the music in the darkness of the night
He considers his own voice as someone else's voice
In this way I give message of patience to my heart
In other words I beguile the night of separation
Rise, as darkness has appeared on the eastern horizon
We should light up the assemblage with blazing songs
Our capacity is only a cry of lament like the wild rue
We should overturn the assemblage with this same uproar
We should show the assemblage the effect of Love’s polish
We should convert the stone of today into the mirror of tomorrow
By showing them the effulgence of the lost Yusuf
We should make them more agitation-prone than Zalaykha’s blood
By giving the lesson of the law of growth to this garden
We should turn the insignificant drop of dew into the ocean
We should lift our dearest chattel from the China' s temple
We should fascinate all with the face of Sa'di and Sulaima
Look! The Lailah' s she camel became useless in Yathrib
We should make Qais acquainted with the new Longing
The wine should be mature and so hot that with it
We should soften the heart of the glass, the goblet, and the decanter
The grief which kept us warm in the cold of the West
Opening up the breast we should make it public
In the world's congregation we should live like the candle
We should burn ourselves and open up the rivals' eyes
"The candle reveals whatever passes through the heart
Burning is not the thought which the candle conceals"
O blood-dripping eye! Now cry to your heart's content
There you can see the mausoleum of the civilization of Hijaz
This was the rendezvous of those Arab Bedouins once
The ocean was the play ground of whose boats once
Who shook up the audience halls of emperors
Thunderbolts were harbored in whose swords
Whose appearance was the message of birth of a new world
Whose restless sword destroyed the whole ancient world
The dead world with whose "Qum" was infused with life
Man was freed from the chains of superstitious beliefs
The ear is still full of pleasures from whose zeal
Is that Takbar now silenced for ever?
Ah! O Sicily! You are giving dignity to the ocean
You are like a guide post in the water's expanse
May the ocean's cheek ever remain elegant with your mole
May your lights ever remain a comfort for the ocean sailor
May your sight ever remain beautiful to traveler’s eyes
May the wave on your shore's rocks ever remain dancing
You were the cradle of that nation's civilization once
Whose universal beauty was the object for spectacle
The Nightingale of Sharaz was the lamentor on Baghdad
Dagh shed the tears of blood on Jahanabad
When the sky destroyed the State of Gharnaèah
The unhappy heart of Ibn Badrun lamented
The ill‑fated Iqbal has been conferred mourning for you
Destiny has selected the heart that was your confidante
Whose story is concealed in your relics?
In your shore's silence is a style of speech
Tell me your pathos, I am also embodiment of pathos
I am the dust of the caravan of which you were a stage
Show me the old picture painted again
Make me restless by relating the tale of bygone days
I will take your gift towards India
I myself weep here, and will make others weep there
The life of Man is no more than a breath!
Breath is a wave of air, it is no more than a flow !
The flower was depicting life as a smile, but
The candle said that it is no more than a cry of grief !
The secret of life is a secret till there is a confidante
When it is open, it is nothing more than the confidante !
Somebody should ask the pilgrims of Ka'bah, O Iqbal
Is the gift of the Haram nothing more than Zamzam?
O God ! Teach a little Love to my happy Intellect .
It loves fine stitching but my shirt has no collar
As I got Love's ardor the angels said on azal's morning
"You are like the grave's candle, you have no assembly"
No friend is available here, this land is friendless, O Heart!
You want something from me which does not exist under the sky
The Arab architect made it distinct from the whole world
The foundation of our nation's fort is not geographical unity
Why this coming and going, future's concern is a conceit
We are manifest in everything, we do not have any homeland
Somebody should take my message to the Makhzan's editor
Activist nations do not have taste for poetic literature!
The world will know when the flood of conversation will emerge from my heart
This is not my silence, but is the shrine of the word of my Longing
As the ocean wave said, "My dignity is established by flowing"
The pearl said, "Sitting in shell is the safety of my brightness"
Whose temperament does not deserve are not improved by training
Reflection of the river bank's cypress does not prosper by living in the water
I did not see any heart in which Longing is not concealed
O God! What is Thy universe! It is a picture gallery of Longing
It dawned after death that our life was a spell of greed
What we called material body, was dust‑cloud of greed's lane
Why am I the embodiment of search if nothing is concealed?
The sight is Longing for the Spectacle, the heart is mad after the Search
The garden's flower bud asked the gardener, "Why is Man so heartless?
The breaking of my wine glass is occasion for smile in your eyes
The effulgence of Love emanates from every speck of the existence' garden
If you know the reality of rose, it is also a combination of color and fragrance"
All my writings are anachronism, my poetry is completely defective
If somebody sees some skill in me it is the fault of my critic
Decorum requires silence, otherwise Thy Mercy is worse than Tyranny
Thou hast given a tiny heart, which also is misled towards greed
Unity's perfection is so evident that if you cut with the knife ' s tip
Sure you would see human blood trickling out of the rose' vein
The age of taqlid has passed, allegorism should depart!
When the Truth itself is evident who is authorized to talk?
If I am far from home, my relatives should not be sad
Like pearl separation from home is perfecting my elegance
Thy splendor is manifest in thunder, in fire, in spark
Thy luster is evident in the moon, in the sun, in the star
Thy elegance exists in skies' heights, and in earths' depths
It is in the ocean's flow, and in falling behind of the shore
Why should Shara`ah be the accuser of the eloquence' taste?
I only conceal the meaning of my heart in metaphors
The real life in Man is pervading in everything
It is in tree, in flower, in animal, in stone, in star
The heat of the drop of Love's tear has consumed me
Boundless fire existed in this little drop of water
There is no longing in me for reward of the Judgment Day
I am the merchant who sees profit in the loss
Being unaware of tranquillity is existence for it
O God! Restlessness of which heart is residing in mercury
O Iqbal I am silent after hearing the call of "Lan Tarana"
Being afflicted with separation I have no strength for importunity
O worldly congregation! Though your gatherings were attractive
Some degree of melancholy there was in your spectacles
Finally that dust acquired comfort in Love
Which had been wandering long in Intellect's wilderness
O Wine! How much enamored you were with the custom of concealment
After emerging from grape's veil you were concealed in the decanter
Knowledge could not comprehend the Beauty's effect
So much ignorance prevailed in all the world's sages
O Iqbal! I have searched for it in Europe in vain
The characteristic which was in the beauties of India
We circumambulate the wine‑cup like the wine's reflection
We are offering this prayer from morning till evening
You are not singular in this O Kalam
Trees and stones are also talking with God
O Candle! Search for a new world, because here
We are enduring tyrannies of the incomplete Love
O Companions! Silence in this garden is good
As the melodious ones are kept in cages here
Those whose purpose is pleasure from wine
Are changing the lawful into the unlawful
How can you and we reconcile, O preacher
As we are making the custom of Love universal!
O God! What magic is concealed in the saints, clad in rags!
That they subdue the youth with a single glance
I shudder at the pleasures of their assemblies
Who are getting fame by destroying their homes
May the meadows of the motherland be ever flourishing
We are saluting you from the ship sailing away
When those un-accustomed to prayers assemble for one, Iqbal
Calling me back from temple they make me their Imam
Time has come for openness, Beloved's Sight will be common
The secret which silence had concealed, will be unveiled now
O Cup‑bearer! Time has gone when wine was taken secretly
The whole world will be tavern, everyone will be drinking
Those who once wandered insane, will return to habitations
Lovers' wandering will be the same but deserts will be new
The Hijaz’ silence has proclaimed to the waiting ear at last
The covenants established with desert's inhabitants will be re‑affirmed
Which coming out of deserts had overturned the Roman Empire
I have heard from the Qudsis that the same lion will be re-awakened
As the cup‑bearer mentioned me in the wine‑drinkers' assembly
The tavern's sage said, "He is insolent, he will be disgraced"
O Western world's inhabitants, God's world is not a shop!
What you are considering genuine, will be regarded counterfeit
Your civilization will commit suicide with its own dagger
The nest built on the frail branch will not be durable
The caravan of the feeble ants will make fleet of rose petals
However strong the ocean waves' tumult be it will cross the ocean
The poppy, roaming in the garden, shows its spots to every f lower-bud
Knowing that by this exhibition it will be counted among the Lovers
O Sight! That was the One you showed us as a thousand
If this is your state what will be your credibility?
As I told the turtledove one day the free of here are treading on dust !
The buds started saying that I must be the knower of the garden's secrets!
There are thousands of God's Lovers, who are roaming in the wilderness
I shall adore the one who will be the lover of God's people
This is the world's custom, O Heart! Even winking is a sin
What will our respect be if you will be restless here?
In the darkness of the night I shall take out my tired caravan
My sigh will be shedding sparks my breath will be throwing f lames
If there is nothing but show in the aim of your life
Your destruction from the world will be in a breath like spark
Do not ask about the condition of Iqbal, he is in the same state
Sitting somewhere by the wayside he must be waiting for oppression!
The region of Delhi is adored by my grieved heart
In every speck of it the ancestors’ blood is asleep
Why should not the land of this desolate garden be holy?
This region is the shrine of the grandeur of Islam
Kings of the Khair al-Umam are asleep in this land
Dependent on whose rule remained the world order
Memory of assembly’s warmth still renders the heart restless
The splendor has been burnt but memory of the splendor is still secure
Though Jahanabad also is a shrine for the Muslim
Baghdad as well is deserving of this magnificence
This is the garden the source of whose pride was
The wild tulip which was called the culture of Hijaz
Why should not the dust of this habitation be equivalent to Iram
Which witnessed the footsteps of the Prophet’s successors
The garden whose flower buds were the garden’s wealth is this
The grave yard of those who made Rome tremble is this
The land of Qurtubah also is the light of the Muslim’s eye
Which shined in Europe’s darkness like the candle of tur
Extinguishing of this lamp dispersed the assembly of Millat-i-Baiza
And lighted the lamp of the present day’s materialistic civilization
This holy region is the grave of that civilization
With which the life blood still exists in the veins of Europe’s vines
The tract of Constantinople that is the Caesar’s city
The perpetual banner of the grandeur of the Ummah’s Mahda
Like the Haram’s dust this region is also holy
It is the shrine of descendants of Shah-i-Lawlak
Its breeze is holy like the fragrance of rose
A voice is calling from the tomb of Ayyub Ansara
“O Muslim! this city is the heart of the Nation of Islam !
This city is the reward for millenniums of blood sacrifices!”
But you are that land, O the resting place of Mustafa
Even to the Ka`bah whose sight is better than Hajj-i-Akbar
In the world’s ring you are shining like a gem
Your land was the birth place of our grandeur
That Magnificent Emperor got rest in your midst
Under whose protection the world nations got security
Whose successors became rulers of world’s empires
Became successors of Caesar, inheritors of Jam’s throne
If the Muslim nationalism is restricted to place
Neither India nor Persia nor Syria is its base
Ah Yathrib! You are the Muslim’s homeland and his shelter
You are the focal point of the rays of his inner feelings
As long as you exist, we will also flourish in the world
You are the morning of this garden we are the dew’s pearls
Are you afraid of the moon or the dawn?
Are you conscious of the end of beauty?
Are you afraid of being robbed of light’s wealth?
Are you afraid of annihilation like the spark?
The sky has settled you far from the earth
It has wrapped you in gold’s mantle like the moon
It is outrageous that your feeble life is still in fear
Your whole night passes in trembling with fear
O shining traveler! This habitation is strange
The rise of one leads to the fall of the other
The birth of one sun is the death of a myriad stars
Annihilation’s sleep is the ecstasy of life’s wine
Flower bud’s departure is the secret of flower’s birth
Is annihilation life’s end, or is the equivalent of life!
Quiescence is difficult in the universe
Only change is permanent in the universe
As two stars came together in the Holy Qur’an
One started saying this to the other
“How excellent if this union together be permanent
How excellent if the end be walking together
If the sky becomes slightly favorable
We two will be with similar glow”
But this longing for the union proved
Completely a message of the end of the union
Revolution is the destiny of the stars
For each its special orbit is fixed
The permanence of union is a mere dream
The rule of the universe is separation !
The sky is clothed in the cloud’s old tattered robe
The mirror of moon’s forehead is somewhat gloomy
The moon light is pale in this silent panorama
The dawn is sleeping in the lap of the night
How astonishing is silence of the trees
This silence is the soft tune of Nature’s harp
The heart of every speck of the universe is pathos embodied
And the silence is a sad sigh on the lips of existence
Ah ! That fort, that universal mustering ground
Is carrying millennia’s weight on its shoulders
Was full of life at one time, now is desolate
This silence is the cemetery of its past elegance
It is the lover of the remains of its old denizens
It is standing on the mountain top like a sentinel
There from the cloud’s window above the sky’s roof
That young green star is viewing the universe
The earth’s vast expanse is a mere child’s play to it
The story of Man’s failure is known to it by heart
This traveler is going to his destination since eternity
Seeing revolutions’ spectacles from the sky’s seclusion
Though quiescence of the star is not possible in the universe
It has stopped momentarily for saying prayer for the dead
This earth is full of flowers of life’s variegations
This earth is the cemetery of many destroyed civilizations
This grief-stricken stage is the resting place of kings
O admonished eye ! Pay the tribute of rosy tears
Though a mere cemetery, this dust ranks with the sky
Ah ! this is the wealth of an unfortunate nation!
So astounding is the grandeur of mausoleums
That the spectator’s eye evades even winking
Such an expression of failure is in this picture
Which is impossible to reflect in description’s mirror
Far from the habitations’ crowds are sleeping
Those who were restless with unfulfilled Longings
The grave’s darkness holds the brilliance of those suns
At whose thresholds the sky used to remain prostrating
Is this the end of these emperors’ magnificence?
Whose diplomatic policies knew no decline
Be it the grandeur of Qaisar or Faghfur’s sway
The foe of death’s assault cannot be turned away
The result of kings’ life-efforts also is the grave
The last stage on path of magnificence is the grave
Neither the happy assembly’s commotion nor the genius’ talk
Not even the wailing people’s whole night’s compassion!
Neither the tumult of the sword in the battle!
Nor the cry of blood warming Takbar !
No call can wake up those who are sleeping
No life can return to the desolate breast
The soul in the handful of dust is enduring injustice
When breath enters non-existence’ flute it is a mere complaint
Human life resembles the sweet singing bird, which
Sat on the branch a while, chirped, flew away
Ah ! For what purpose did we come in the world, for what purpose did we go away!
Sprouted from the life’s branch, blossomed, faded away
Death is interpretation of the dream of the king and the poor alike
This atrocious one’s terror is the picture of justice
The stream of life is a boundless ocean
And the grave is a wave of this boundless ocean
O ambition! Shed tears of blood as this life is unreliable
It is the smile of the spark, it is the flammable straw
This moon which is a miracle of the Lord of the universe
Clad in the robe of gold is slowly and proudly strolling
But in the frightening vastness of the starless sky
Its helplessness is worth watching at time of dawn
What was the moon is a mere piece of cloud
Whose destruction is in the last tear drop
Similarly unpredictable is the life of nations
Their glory is a picture of the happy times gone by
In this world no nation however prestigious it may be
Can continue its existence till the end of time
So much accustomed to nations’ destruction is the universe
That it watches this scene with indifference
Nothing stays the same without change
The universe’ nature is made of change
The beauty of world’s jewel is in ever-changing names
The mother earth has always remained expecting new nations!
This highway is acquainted with thousands of caravans
Koh-i-Nur’s eye is familiar with innumerable kings
Egypt and Babylon are annihilated, not a mark remains
The roll of existence does not have even their names
The evening of death has overpowered the sun of Iran
Time has robbed the grandeur of Greece and Rome
Ah! The Muslim also from the world similarly departed
The azar cloud appeared over the horizon, rained and departed
The rose petal’s vein is a string of pearls with dawn’s tears
Some ray of the sun is enmeshed in the dew
The river’s breast is the cradle for sun’s rays
How beautiful is the sun’s sight at the river bank!
Juniper is busy in beautifying, river is the mirror
For the flower bud spring breeze is the mirror
The cuckoo remains calling from the garden’s nest
Remains hidden from the human eye in the leaves’ privacy
And the nightingale, the flowery singer of the garden
By whose presence is alive the glory of the garden
Is a living picture of the commotion of Love
How beautiful is this picture from Nature’s pen!
In the garden the roses silent assemblies are holding
The shepherd boys’ shouts in the valley are echoing
This old world is so full of life
That in death also is hidden the zest of life
The petals fall in autumn in the same way
As toys fall from the sleeping infant’s hand
In this cheerful world though luxury is limitless
One grief, that is grief of the Millat is always fresh
Memories of the age gone by are still fresh in our heart
This Ummah cannot erase its kings’ memories form its heart
These desolate mansions are excuses for shedding tears
Insight has developed in the eye with continuous tears
We give to the world the pearls of the weeping eye
We are the remaining clouds of a storm gone by
There are hundreds of pearls in this cloud’s breast
Thunder still lurks in this cloud’s silent breast
It can change the dry wilderness to a flowery vale
It can change the farmer’s hope from slumber to awakening
The manifestation of this nation’s majesty has passed
But the manifestation of its beauty has not yet passed
From under the horizon’s skirt is appearing
The day and night’s virgin daughter that is dawn
The sky has completed benedictions for the star’s crop
The sun has decorated the eastern horizon with mirrors
The sky, getting news of the arrival of the sun
Has packed up night’s litter on dust-cloud’s shoulders
The sun’s flame seems to be the produce of this field
Which was sown by sky’s farmer as sparks of stars
The morning star is on the way from the sky retrieving
As the last nightly worshiper from the mosque be retrieving
What a beautiful sight it is as somebody slowly
Draws the bright sword from the sheath’s darkness
The dawn’s meaning in the eastern horizon is hidden
As inside the goblet the pleasant wine is hidden
The dawn is under the skirt of the friendly breeze
The noise of the conch is mixed with the call of adhan
All the singing birds woke up by the cuckoo’s call
Every string of dawn’s system has become musical
I always remain roaming like the morning breeze
Roaming is more pleasant in Love than destination
The restless heart reached the land of the Saint of Sanjar
Where the cure for the malady of impatience is available
The longing of my heart had not yet reached the lips
The tongue was about to be obligated to the power of speech
A voice came from the tomb, “The Haram’s inhabitants have
A complaint against you, O renouncer of ancestors’ ways!
O Qais ! How has your internal warmth cooled down?
Because Lailah still has the same ways of her old self
The seed of “La Ilaha” did not sprout in your barren soil
The sterility of your nature is universally disgraced
O imprudent one! Do you know what your life is?
It is the builder of synagogues, full of church music
Though your training has been in the House of God
Your rebellious heart is the lover of temple
“You learnt fidelity from us but used it on others
You snatched a pearl from us but sacrificed it on others”
Though the wine of life is the embodiment of pleasure
The cloud of life carries tears also in its skirt
The bubble of life dances on the wave of grief
“Alam’s” Surah is also part of the Book of Life
By losing even a single petal the rose ceases to be rose
If the nightingale is unaware of autumn it ceases to be nightingale
The heart’s story is colored with Longing’s blood
The human music is incomplete without lament’s cry
For the discerning eye the grief’s scar is insight
For the soul sigh’s mirror is beauty’s accompaniment
Incidents of grief give perfection to human nature
The dust of anguish is rouge for the heart’s mirror
Youth is awakened from sleep’s pleasure by grief
This orchestra wakes up with this plectrum alone
For the heart’s bird grief is the strongest feather
The human heart is a secret whose disclosure is grief
Grief is not distress, but is the soul’s silent song
Which is locked in the embrace of existence’ harp
Whose night is not acquainted with “Ya Rab”’s plaint!
Whose night does not manifest the stars of tears
Whose heart’s cup does not know breaking with grief
Who always remained ecstatic with pleasure and exhilaration
The gardener whose hand is safe from thorn’s tip
Whose love is unaware of the pathos of separation
Though grief’s affliction is far from his life
The secret of life is concealed from his eyes
O the one with comprehension of life’s affairs
Why should not grief and sorrow be easy for you?
Love is the introduction to the Eternity’s old treatise
Human intellect is mortal but Love is eternally alive
The evening of death is no match to the sun of Love
Love is the warmth of life and lasts till eternity
If annihilation had been intended for the departed beloved
Love’s zeal would have also departed from the Lover’s heart
Love does not die by the beloved’s death
It stays in the soul as grief but does not die
Lover’s immortality is the beloved’s immortality
The beloved’s life is unacquainted with mortality
The spring comes singing from the mountain top
Teaching the art of singing to the birds of the sky
Its mirror is bright like the Houri’s cheek
But falling on valley’s rocks it is shattered
The river’s pearls ever more beautiful became
That is by this fall they water’s stars became
The river of flowing mercury spread and became scattered
A whole entire world of restless drops became manifest
But separation is the training for reunion to those drops
After a while the same river is running like a silver string
The flowing river of life is of the same origin
Falling from high it became the concourse of humanity
In the depths of this world we part to reunite
But we cry considering temporary parting as permanent
Though the dead do die they do not perish
Really they do not get separated from us
When Intellect be surrounded in worldly calamities
Or when it be besieged in the dreary night of youth
When the heart’s skirt be the battle field of good and evil
When journey to the goal be difficult in road’s darkness
When the Khizar of courage may be resigned from longing
When Intellect be helpless and conscience a silent voice
When not a single fellow-traveler be in the vale of life
When not even fire-fly’s spark to show the way there be
The foreheads of the dead brighten up in this darkness
As stars are shining in the darkness of the night
When that exquisite beauty strolls into the garden
Every single flower bud recites this supplication
“O God! Out of all flowers he may he pick me!
From flower-bud into full flower he may turn me”
He may pluck you from the branch! How lucky you are
Your rivals in the garden may flounce at you
From pangs of separation to the union you reached
The essence of your life to perfection reached
My lotus, which beauty’s worshipers adore
Which the prime of my youth does ever adore
This flower could never attain its objective
Could never know some one’s colorful skirt
Spring will never be able to make it bloom
Waiting for the gardener ever keeps it sad
China and Arabia are ours, India is also ours
We are Muslims, whole world is homeland of ours
The trust of Divine Unity is in the breasts of ours
It is not easy to destroy the identity of ours
Among the world’s temples that first House of God
We are its sentinels, it is the sentinel of ours
We have been brought up under the shade of swords
The crescent’s dagger is the national insignia of ours
Our Adhan echoed in the valleys of the West
None could stop the advancing flood of ours
We cannot be bowed down by falsehood, O sky
Hundreds of times you have done tests of ours
O garden of Andalus ! Do you remember the days
When your branches harbored the nest of ours?
O wave of the Tigris ! You also recognize us
Your river still recites the stories of ours
O Holy Land ! For your honor we fought to the bitter end
Still flowing in your veins is the blood of ours
The Hijaz’s Chief is the commander of our caravan
This name preserves solace of the hearts of ours
This anthem of Iqbal is the clarion’s call so to say
Again prepares for the journey the caravan of ours
In this age the wine, the cup, even Jam is different
The cup-bearer started different ways of grace and tyranny
The Muslim also constructed a different haram of his own
The Azar of civilization made different idols of his own
Country, is the biggest among these new gods!
What is its shirt is the shroud of Dan
This idol which is the product of the new civilization
Is the plunderer of the structure of the Holy Prophet’s Dan
Your arm is enforced with the strength of the Divine Unity
You are the followers of Musèafa , your country is Islam
You should show the old panorama to the world
O Musèafaa’s follower ! You should destroy this idol
The limitation to country results in destruction
Live like the fish in the ocean free from country
Renouncing the country is the way of the God’s Beloved
You should also testify to the Prophethood’s Truth by similar action
In political parlance country is something different
In Prophet’s command country is something different
The antagonism among world’s nations is created by this alone
Subjugation as the goal of commerce is created by this alone
Politics have become bereft of sincerity is by this alone
The destruction of the home of the weak is by this alone
God’s creation is unjustly divided among nations by it
The Islamic concept of nationality is uprooted by it
The caravan has been robbed in wilderness and the destination is far
The coast of this desolation, that is this dry ocean is far
My fellow travelers became victims of the robbers’ dagger
The remaining ones turned back to Makkah in frustration
How willingly this young man from Bukhara gave his life!
In the poison of death he has found the taste of life!
The robber’s dagger was the Eid’s crescent to him
“Ah Yathrib” was within heart, Tawhad’s slogan was on the lips
Fear says, “Do not travel alone towards Yathrib”
Longing says, “You are a Muslim, travel fearlessly”
“Would I return to Makkah without paying homage?
Would I not appear confidently before Lovers on the Judgment Day?
The traveler through Hijaz’ wilderness has no fear for life
This secret is hidden in the emigration of the Holy Prophet
Thought safety is in the companionship of the Syrian litter
Pleasure of Love is in the heart-breaking affliction of danger
Ah! How clever this timid Intellect is!
And the brave man’s feeling how fearless is!
Yesterday a desperate Lover was saying with wailing at the Prophet’s tomb
“The Egyptian and Indian Muslims dare destroying the Millat’s foundation!
These pilgrims to the West’s sanctuary may fake our leadership
What bond do we have with those who have remained unacquainted with you?
Outrageous are these “self-seeking spiritual leaders”, May God protect your Millat
They are promoting their own glory by destroying the Muslims
O Iqbal who would listen to you, the congregation has changed
You are telling us these tales of the old in the new age
Why should I be destructive and remain reckless of betterment?
Think not of the future, remain occupied in today’s problems?
Should I hear nightingale’s wails, and remain completely silent?
O companion! Am I some flower so that I may remain silent?
The strength of my poetry is encouraging to me
Woe be to me ! My remonstrance is against God!
It is true that we are famous in the methods of obeisance
But we are relating our story of pain out of compulsion
Though a silent orchestra, we are full of complaint
If the wailing comes to lips we are excusable
O God! Listen to the remonstrance also from the faithful
Listen to some complaint also from the one accustomed to praise you
Though Thy Eternal Essence had existed since eternity
The flower existed in the garden but fragrance had not dispersed
Justice is a condition, O Lord of Universal Benevolence
How could flower’s fragrance spread if zephyr did not exist?
This problem’s solution was the source of satisfaction to us
Otherwise was the Holy Prophet’s Ummah insane?
The scene of Thy world was strange before us
Stones were adored somewhere, trees were worshipped somewhere
The eyes of Man were accustomed to tangible forms
How could they be amenable to accept the Unseen God?
Doth Those know who ever told Thy beads?
The strength of the Muslim’s arm completed Thy task!
Saljuqs were living here and the Turanas also
The Chinese in China and in Iran the Sasanas also
The Greeks were also living in the same habitation
In the same world were the Jews and the Christians also
But who raised the sword in Thy name?
Who reclaimed the despoiled world in Thy name?
We alone were the marshals of Thy troops!
We were fighting now on land and now in the oceans
Some times we were calling adhans in the Europe’s cathedrals
And sometimes in the scorching African deserts
We never cared for the grandeur of monarchs
We recited the Kalimah under the shade of swords
If we lived we lived for the calamities of wars
If we died we died for the grandeur of Thy name
We did not wield the sword for our kingdoms
Did we roam about the world fearlessly for wealth?
If our nation had been greedy of worldly wealth
Why would we have been idol breakers instead of idol sellers ?
Once firmly standing in the battle we were immovable
Even lions in the battle against us would be in flight
We were enraged if some one rebelled against Thee
Not to talk of sword we were fighting against canons
We impressed Tawhad’s picture on every heart
We conveyed this message even under the dagger
Tell us Thou, by whom was uprooted the gate of Khaibar
By whom was conquered the city which was Qaisar’s ?
By whom were the images of created gods destroyed?
By whom were the armies of infidels slaughtered?
By whom was the fire temple of Iran extinguished?
By whom was the story of Yazdan restored to life?
Which nation did become Thy seeker exclusively?
And became embroiled in wars’ calamities for Thee?
Whose world-conquering sword did world-ruler become?
By whose Takbar did Thy world enlightened become?
Through whose fear idols did perpetually alarmed remain?
Falling on their faces saying “Huwa Allah O Ahad did remain?
If the time of prayer right during the battle fell
Hijaz’ nation in prostration facing the Ka’abah fell
Both Mahmud and Ayaz in the same row stood
None as the slave and none as the master stood
The slave and the master, the poor and the rich all became one!
On arrival in Thy Audience all were reduced to one!
We continuously wandered all over the world
We wandered like the wine-cup with Tawhad’s wine
We wandered with Thy Message in the mountains, in the deserts
And doth Thou know whether we ever returned unsuccessful?
What of the deserts! We did not spare even oceans!
We galloped our horses in the dark ocean !
We effaced falsehood from the earth’s surface
We freed the human race from bonds of slavery
We filled Thy Ka’bah with our foreheads
We put Thy Qur’an to our hearts
Still Thou complaineth that we are lacking fealty
If we are lacking fealty Thou also art not generous
There are other ummahs, among them are sinners also
There are modest people and arrogant ones also
Among them are slothful, indolent as well as clever people
There are also hundreds who are disgusted with Thy name
Thy Graces descend on the other people’s abodes
Lightning strikes only the poor Muslims’ abodes
The idols in temples say ‘The Muslims are gone’
They are glad that the Ka’bah’s sentinels are gone
From the world’s stage the huda singers are gone
They, with the Qur’an in their arm pits, are gone
Infidelity is mocking, hast Thou some feeling or not?
Dost Thou have any regard for Thy own Tawhad or not?
We do not complain that their treasures are full
Who are not in possession of even basic social graces
Outrageous that infidels are rewarded with Houris and palaces
And the poor Muslims are placated with only promise of Houris
We have been deprived of the former graces and favors
What is the matter, we are deprived of the former honors?
Why is the material wealth rare among Muslims?
Thy omnipotence is boundless and inestimable
With Thy Will the desert’s bosom would produce bubbles
The desert’s rambler can be facing flood of mirage’s waves
Others’ sarcasm, disgrace and poverty is our lot
Is abjection the reward for Loving Thee ?
Now, this world is the lover of others
For us it is only an imaginary world
We have departed, others have taken over the world
Do not complain now that devoid of Tawhad has become the world
We live with the object of spreading Thy fame in the world
Can the wine-cup exist if the cup-bearer does not live?
Thy assemblage is gone, and Thy Lovers are also gone
The night’s sighs and the dawn’s wailings are gone
They had loved Thee, they are gone with their rewards
They had hardly settled down and they were turned out
The Lovers came but with tomorrow’s promise were sent away
Now seek them with Thy beautiful face’s lamp every way!
Lailah’s pathos is the same, and Qais’ bosom is the same
In the Najd’s wilderness and mountains the deer’s running is the same
The Love’s heart is the same, the Beauty’s magic is the same
The Ummah of the Holy Prophet is the same, Thou art the same
Why then this displeasure without reason is?
Why then this displeasure for Thy Lovers is?
Did we forsake Thee, did we forsake the Arabian Holy Prophet?
Did we adopt idol sculpture, did we idol breaking forsake?
Did we forsake Love, and did we forsake the madness of Love?
Did we forsake the customs of Salman and Uwais of Qur’an ?
We have the Takbar’s fire suppressed in our hearts!
We are living the life of Bilal the Negro!
Granted that Love has lost its former elegance also
We may have lost treading the path of Love also
We may have lost the restless heart like the compass also
And we may have lost the observance of fidelity’s rules also
Thou art changing friendship between us and others
It is difficult to say but Thou art also unfaithful !
Thou perfected the Dan on the peak of Faran
Thou captivated the hearts of thousands in a moment
Thou consumed the produce of Love with fire
Thou burned the congregation with Thy face’s fire
Why are not our breasts filled with Love’s sparks now?
We are the same Lovers, dost Thou not remember now?
The noise of Lovers’ chains in the Najd’s Valley has disappeared
Qais has no more remained longing for the litter’s sight
Those old ambitions, we, as well as the heart have disappeared
The house is destroyed as Thou art not present in the house
O that happy day when Thou with elegance will come back
When Thou unveiled to our congregation will come back
Others are sitting at the stream bank in the rose garden
Listening to the cuckoo’s call with wine-cup in their hand
In the garden on a side far from the riotous crowd are sitting
Thy Lovers are also patiently wanting for a Hu!
Again endow Thy moths with Longing for burning themselves
Give the command for consumption in Love to the old lightning
The wandering nation is riding again towards Hijaz
The taste of flight has carried the unfledged nightingale
The fragrance of humility is restless in every flower bud
Just start the music, orchestra is seeking the plectrum
Songs are restless to come out of the strings
tur is impatient for burning in the same fire
Make easy the difficulties of the blessed Ummah
Place the poor ant shoulder to shoulder to Sulaiman
Make the invaluable produce of Love accessible again
Change the idolatrous Muslims of India into Muslims again
A stream of blood drips from the frustrations mine
Wailing palpitates in the wounded breast of mine!
The rose’ fragrance took garden’s secret outside the garden
Outrageous that flowers themselves are informers against the garden
The spring is over, broken is the orchestra of the garden
Flown away from branches are the songsters of the garden
Only a nightingale is left which is singing still
In its breast overflows the flood of songs still
Turtle-doves from the juniper’s branches are gone also
Flower petals dropping from the flower are scattered also
The garden’s old beautiful walk-ways are gone also
The branches became bare of the cover of leaves also
But his nature remained free of the season’s restrictions
Would somebody in the garden understand his complaint!!
There is no pleasure in dying and no taste in living is
If there is any pleasure it in bearing this affliction is
Many a virtue is restless in my mirror!
Many an effulgence is fluttering in my breast!
But there is none in this garden to see them
There are no poppies with Love’s stain on their breasts
May hearts open up with the song of this lonely nightingale
May the sleeping hearts wake up with this very Bang-i-Dara
May the hearts come to life again with a new covenant
May the hearts be thirsty again for this same old wine
My alembic may be from `Ajam, but my wine is from Hijaz
The song may be Indian but my tune is from Hijaz
O moon! Your beauty is the dignity of creation
Circumambulating the earthly sanctuary is your old habit
This something like a spot which appears on your breast
Are you someone’s Lover? Is this the Longing’s scar?
I am restless on the earth, you are impatient in the sky
You are also in search, I am also in search
Man is the candle of the congregation which is also yours
The direction in which I am going is also your destination
The one you are searching for in the stars’ silence
Perhaps is concealed in the commotion of life
It is standing is the cypress tree, is sleeping in the verdure
Is singing in the nightingale, is silent in the flower bud
Come, I shall show you His luminous cheek
In rivers’ mirror, in dew’s looking glass
In forest, in mountains in everything only He exists
In the heart of Man, in your cheek only He exists
Part 1
Rat ( The Night )
Why in my light are you roaming about perturbed?
Silent like the rose, like the fragrance perturbed
Perhaps you are the jeweler of the star’s pearls
Perhaps you are some fish of the river of my light
Or you are a star fallen from my forehead
Which, leaving eminence has adopted habitation in humility
Quiet has become the string of the harp of life
In my mirror is the picture of the dream of life
At the bottom of the river the whirlpool’s eye is asleep
By the river bank the restless wave has fallen asleep
How tumultuous the habitation of the earth is
Has fallen asleep as if it not even inhabited is
But the poet’s heart is unacquainted with peace
How did you remain free from my enchantment?
Part 2
Sha`ir ( The Night)
I am sowing pearls in the fields of your moon
Hiding from people I weep like the dawn
Being shy of coming out in the day’s commotion
My tears start dripping in the night’s seclusion
To whom should I relate the lament concealed in me?
To whom should I show the scene of the heat of Love ?
Aiman’s lightning is lying on my breast and weeping
Where the eye which has insight is sleeping?
My congregation is dead like the grave’s candle
Ah! O night my destination is very far
The present day conditions are not amenable to it
There is no perception of it’s own loss in it
When I become tired of the restraint of Love’s message
Coming here I relate them to your shining states!
While setting, the sun threw at the dark-clothed evening
Tulip flowers which it had collected from horizon’s basin
The twilight of evening put all ornaments of gold on it,
Nature put off its entire set of silver ornaments
The Lailah of the night in the litter of silence arrived
Started shining the beautiful pearls of the evening’s bride
Those living far from the commotion of the world
Which Man calls “stars” in his own language
The sky’s assembly was busy lighting up the sky
From the `Arsh-i-Baran the call of an angel came
"O sentinels of the night! O stars of the sky!
The whole shining nation of yours inhabits the sky
Start such music as may awaken all those sleeping
The brightness of your forehead is guide for caravans
The earth’s denizens consider you the destiny’s mirrors
Perhaps they will listen to your call”
Silence departed from this star-spangled expanse
The sky’s expanse was filled with this music
The Eternal Beauty is produced in the stars’ loveliness
As the image of rose is in the looking glass of the dew
To be afraid of the new ways, to insist on the old ones
This is the only difficult stage in the life of nations
This caravan of life is so fast moving
Many a nation is trampled in whose race
Thousands of stars are hidden from our eyes
But their existence is also included in our group
The earth’s denizens did not understand in a whole life
What has come in our comprehension in a short span of life
All systems are established on mutual attraction
This secret is concealed in the life of the stars”
As only imagination was my fellow-traveler
My path happened to pass through the sky
I was flying constantly and no one
Was acquainted with me in the sky
The stars were staring at me in surprise
My journey was a well guarded secret
I escaped from the alternation of day and night
I escaped from this ancient order of things
What can I tell you what Paradise is
It is the climax of material longings
Birds were singing in the branches of tubah
Unabashed Houri’s beauty was present all around
Beautiful cup-bearers with wine-cups in hand
The audience was crying drink more and more”
Far from the Paradise the eye observed
There was a dark house, cold and silent
Countenance of Qais and Lailah’s material form
Were shoulder to shoulder with its darkness
It was so cold that being embarrassed by it
The Arctic Circle was concealing its face
When I inquired about its condition
The reply of the angel was strange
“This cold place is called Hell
It is deprived of fire and light
The heat of its flames which is borrowed
Terrifies the people seeking admonition
When the earth’s people come here
They bring their embers with them”
One day by way of advice I said to Iqbal
Neither you fast nor are regular in prayers
You are also perfect in the ways of hypocritical people
You pine for London in the heart but you talk of Hijaz
Your lies are also based on what is expediency
The manner of your flattery also is fully miraculous
Your lecture ends on glorification of the government
Your bright thought is the inventor of methods of entreating
Officials’ doors are also like Maqam-i-Mahmud to you
Your designs are more interlocked than locks of Ayaz’ hair
Like other people you can also conceal
Secrets of self aggrandizement in your cloak of din’s service
You are seen in the mosque also on the Eid day
Your heart is also softened by the sermon’s effect
You practice reading country’s newspapers also
Which are obligated to sing your repute’s songs
On top of all this you can also write verse
Your poetry’s goblets are full of the wine of Shiraz
Whatever are the attributes of leaders, you have them all
Incumbent on you is rising and joining the struggle
You are not afraid of hunters, as you have wings also
Then why are you not inclined for flight?
“The end of our life is the cemetery
Presently raise tumult in the sky’s vault”
Overflowing with the wine of Truth is the cup of India
All philosophers of the Western world have acknowledged India
It is the result of the elegant thinking of Indians
That higher than the sky is the position of India
This country has had many people of angelic disposition
On whose account world renowned is the name of India
India is proud of the existence of Rama
Spiritual people consider him prelate of India
This alone is the miracle of this light of righteousness
That brighter than world’s morning is the evening of India
He was expert in sword craft, was unique in bravery
Was matchless in piety and in the enthusiasm of love
How rightly Jogender said this yesterday
“The car of Zulfiqar ‘Ala Khan is so quiet
Its elegant and graceful pace is not noisy
Fast like lightning, like breeze it is quiet”
I replied “This is not restricted to car
In the path of life every fleet footed is quiet
The bell is footless from its habit of lamenting
The caravan of fragrance like zephyr is quiet
The decanter always walks on embers due to gurgling
But the nature of the gentle-moving wine-cup is quiet
To the poet’s thoughts the wings for flight are silence
The wealth of the voice’s warmth lies in silence”!
The sights of the garden may or may not be beautiful
The narcissus, unable to act, forced to watching is!
It does not appreciate the pleasure of movement
The very nature of juniper devoid of longing is!
Whatever is in the world is accustomed to submission
Every power of Man busy in pressing for his Longing is!
This speck remains incessantly ambitious of expansion
Not a speck but perhaps the constricted wilderness he is
If he wills he can change the face of the garden
This entity wise, clear-sighted and powerful is
O Muslim youth ! Have you ever used your prudence
What was that sky of which you are a fallen star?
That nation has nurtured you its lap of love
Whose feet had trampled the crown of Dara’s head
Civilization’s formulator, creator of rules of world government
Was that desert of Arabia, that is the cradle of camel drivers
“Al Faqru fakhra’s ” state even in glory of authority existed
“Why would the beautiful face need beautifying and cosmetics”
Even in poverty those men of God were so high-minded
That the rich could not avoid charity for beggar’s fear
In short what should I tell you what those wanderers in wilderness were
They were world conquerors, world rulers, world administrators, and world adorners
If I wish to present their picture in words I can
But that scene is beyond the comprehension of your imagination
You cannot have any relationship with your ancestors
You are talk, they were action, you are stars, they were planets
We have wasted the heritage obtained from our ancestors
The sky has thrown us down from the Thurayyah to the earth
Why should we cry for suzerainty, as it was temporary
There is no escape from the world’s established principles
But those pearls of wisdom, those books of our ancestors
By seeing them in Europe the heart is rent asunder
“O Ghani ! witness the dark day of the saint of Kina‘an
Because the light of his eyes brightens Zulaikhah’s eyes
O the pride of Shawwal ! O the fasting person’s darling!
Come ! As Muslims were very anxiously waiting for you
The message of Eid is written on your forehead
Your evening is the preface to the dawn of pleasure
You are the mirror of the history of Millat-i-BaiÉah
O crescent ! We are your lovers since a very long time
The banner 3 under whose shade we wielded our swords
Under whose shade we used the blood of our enemies
The companionship of this very banner is your destiny
The Millat’s honor is by your ever-increasing beauty
Our nation is cherisher of friends, fidelity is your way
This silvery shirt of yours is the propagator of love
Look at the earth’s habitation from your celestial apses!
Look at the depth of our abode from your eminence!
Look at the caravans and also look at their fast speed
At the destitute traveler’s estrangement with destination also look
On sighting you we used to give charity lavishly
O empty cup ! Today at our indigence also look
Muslims are tightly bound in chains of sectarianism
Look at your freedom and at their bondage also look
In the mosque look at disintegration of the priest’s love
In the temple at the Brahman’s strong idol-worship also look
Look at the sight of the Muslim ways in the infidels’ life
And at your Muslims’ tormenting other Muslims also look
Be the spectator of the shower of rocks of misfortunes
At the frailty of the Muslims Ummah’s abodes also look
Yes, look at the advance flattery of the ‘honorable’ people
And at the self-respect of the formerly shameless people also look
Whom we got acquainted with the taste of eloquence
At the haughty speech of that former speechless adversary look
Listen to sounds of pleasurable orchestra in West’s palaces
And at the preparations for the mourning in Iran also look
The imprudent Turk has torn the cloak of the Divine Khilafah
Look at Muslims’ simplicity at other’s cunningness also look
Look at everything, and remain quiet like a mirror
In today tumult remain occupied in evening’s music!
The Poet
Last night I said to the candle of my desolate house
“Your hair gets combed by the wings of the moth
In the world I am like the lamp of the wilderness’ tulip
I am neither in an assembly’s lot, nor in a house’ fortune
Since a long time I am also burning my breath like you
Though I am circling the flame no moth has hit its wing
Many an effulgence is crammed in my life of unfulfilled desires
Not a single loving heart rises in this assembly
From where have you acquired this world-illuminating fire?
You have infused the love of Kalam in the poor insect” !
The Candle
“The blow of breath which gives me the message of death
By the same blow of breath your lip is melodious
I am alight because burning is built into my nature
You are alight so that the moths may have the love of yours
I am weeping because a flood gushes forth from my heart
You shed dew so that garden’s assembly may sing praises yours
My morning is adorned with the roses from my night’s toil
Your tomorrow is unaware of the today of yours
Though you are lightened your are devoid of the inner heat
Like the lamp of the wilderness’ tulip is the flame of yours
Just think if cup-bearer’s title is appropriate for you
Assembly is thirsty and the wine-measure is empty of yours
Your ways are different, the law of the Millat is different
Your mirror has been disgraced by the ugly appearance of yours
With the Ka‘bah by your side you are temple’s lover
How rebellious is the irresponsible love of yours
That Qais be produced in your assembly is not possible
Your wilderness is straitened, without Lailah is the litter of yours
O brilliant pearl ! O the one reared in the wave’s lap
Unacquainted with the taste of storms is the ocean of yours
Why are you singing now? your garden is in disorder!
Your singing is out of place, your music is out of season
Those who were anxious for the Spectacle have departed
Your coming now with general Sighting’s promise matters little
Those old ardent lovers of wine are gone from the assembly
O cub-bearer ! Your coming now in assembly with strong wine in the cup matters little
Ah ! When the rose garden’s organization has already got disorganized
If the flower got the message of spring breeze matters little
The lover’s condition was worth seeing at the night’s end
The Beloved’s arrival early in the morning matters little
Extinguished is the flame which was every moth’s objective
If some pursuer of perfect love came now it matters little
The flowers do not care, you may or may not sing
The caravan is callous, the bell may or may not ring
If devoid of love’s warmth you remained even as assembly’s candle
Your moths also unacquainted with this taste remained
If you could string them together on the thread of Love
Then why did the beads of your rosary scattered remain?
Gone is the courageous Love, gone is the sublime thinking
In your assembly neither the insane nor the sages remain
Gone is that burning of Love, gone is that heart’s pathos
What good it is if the moths round the candle did remain?
Very well, the cup-bearer you may be, whom will you serve wine
Now neither those wine-drinkers nor those taverns did remain
Today a broken decanter is crying for the cup-bearer
Whose goblets in circulation till yesterday did remain
Today are silent those Love-cherishing expanses
Where Lailah and her lovers dancing did remain
How disappointing ! The caravan’s wealth is gone
The feeling of loss from caravan’s heart is gone
With whose activities the wilderness was once flourishing
Their cities are wiped out, habitations desolate have became
The prayers which established the grandeur of Tawhad
Those prayers offerings to Brahman in India have become
In this world ever-lasting comfort on laws’ observance depends
To the ocean wave freedoms prelude to lamentation have become
The Manifestation Itself was longing for whose eyes
Those eyes despaired of Aiman’s light have become
Thousands of nightingales were flying about in the rose-garden
What happened to them that they confined to the nests have become ?
In the celestial expanse whose lightning power was panoramic
Those lightning’s satiated with the barn’s sides have become
Why should the blood letting eye ingratiated to the rose garden be ?
With continuous tears the eyes fully satiated with embers have become
However, the grief’s night gives the message of ‘Eid’s morning
In the darkness of the night the ray of hope has appeared
Glad tidings, O cup-bearer of the tavern of Hijaz
After ages your rinds have regained consciousness
Wealth of self-respect was the price for other’s wine
Now your shop is again full of calls for the carousal
About to break is the magic of India’s white faced masters
Again the Sulaima’s eye is the harbinger of clamor’s message
There is clamor again for cup-bearer to bring the home-made wine
As the heart’s uproars have been silenced by the West’s wine
Sing because this is not the time for silence
The dawn’s sky is shouldering the sun like decanter
Burn in sympathy with others and also make others burn
Listen if you can, a bright Hadath has been conveyed to you
Ancestors have said that poetry is a part of prophethood
Yes, convey to the Millat the glad tidings of the Messenger Angel !
Awaken the eye with the promise of the Beloved’s Sight
Bring the heart to life with the warmth of speech’s skill
Your love for indulgence became a robber of courage
You were an ocean in wilderness, in garden a brook you became
When you stood firm in your purity, you had the nation also
Caravan of fragrance after leaving the rose scattered became
The life of the drop has lessons of the secrets of life
Sometimes pearl, sometimes dew, sometimes tear it became
Obtain it from somewhere it is a great wealth
What good is life if the heart unaware of bosom became
Your honor depended upon the organization of the Millat
When this organization departed, disgraced world wide you became
The individual is firm by nation’s coherence, otherwise nothing
The wave is only in the ocean, and outside it is nothing
Keep the love concealed in your heart’s veil still
That is do not disgrace your wine like the decanter
Pitch your tent in the Valley of Sinai like Kalam
Make the Truth’s flame destroyer of home’s comfort
The candle should also know the result of atrocities
Make the moth’s ashes restorer of the morning
If you are self-respecting be not obliged to the cup-bearer
In the ocean’s midst turn the goblet up side down like the bubble
No joy remains in the old mountains and wilderness
Your love is new, you should create new wilderness
If the destiny has destroyed you completely
From downfall make a new rod like the seed
Yes !@ Build your nest again on the same old branch
Make the rose garden’s residents martyrs of the song of intoxication
In this garden be the nightingale’s follower or rose’ pupil
Either be all complaint or do not produce any music
Why are you silent in the garden like dew’s retreat
Open your lips, you are the music of the world’s harp!
Become somewhat acquainted with your own reality O farmer!
The grain, the cultivation, the rain, as well as the produce you are
Ah ! Whose search keeps you aimlessly wandering
The path, the traveler, the guide, as well as the destination you are
Why is your heart trembling with the fear of the storm?
The sailor, the ocean, the boat, as well as the sea-shore you are
Come and look some time in the lane of the torn collars
Qais, Lailah, the wilderness as well as the litter on the camel you are
Woe foolishness ! You are in need of the cup-bearer
The wine, the decanter, the cup-bearer, as well as the assembly you are
Becoming a flame burn down the rubbish of Godlessness
Why are you afraid of the falsehood? The destroyer of falsehood also you are
O imprudent one ! You are the essence of time’s mirror
The ultimate message of God in the world you are !
O imprudent one ! Be aware of your own reality as
Though you are only a drop your reality is also like the boundless ocean
Why are you imprisoned in the spell of poor resources
Just look, concealed in you is also the storm’s power!
Your breast is custodian of the love’s message of the one
Who is Apparent as well as Hidden in the universe’ system
What conquers the whole world without sword and gun
If you understand the material is also in your mettle
O indolent One! Do you remember that covenant also?
On which Mount Faran till now is a silent witness
O ignorant one ! Only you became contented with some flower buds
Otherwise in the rose-garden there is also cure for the receiver’s small capacity!
The heart’s state is produced in the speech’s curtain
In decanter’s veil the wine is apparent as well as veiled
My fiery music has burnt me down
And this is the very means of my life!
Look into my breast for the secret of this fiery music
Look into heart’s mirror for destiny’s manifestation !
The sky will shine mirror-like with the morning’s light
And the night’s darkness will be speeding away!
The spring breeze will be so melody inspiring
That flower-bed’s silent fragrance will become melodious!
The garden’s afflicted ones will unite with other afflicted ones
The zephyr will become companion of the rose’ assembly!
My gentle spray of dew will produce warmth and music
Every flower-bud of this garden will become appreciative of pathos!
You will see the result of the glory of the river’s flow
The restless wave itself will become its ankle’s chain!
The hearts will again recall the message of prostrations
The foreheads will become acquainted with the Haram’s dust
The hunter’s wailing will give material for the birds’ singing
Colored with flower-picker’s blood the flower-bud will became
Whatever the eye is seeing cannot be described by the lips
I am lost in amazement as to what the world will become !
The night will eventually disappear by sun’s appearance!
This garden will be filled with the Light of Tawhad!
O Iqbal ! Every breath of yours is veiled in sighs
Your burning breast is filled with complaint
The song of hope does not exist in the harp of your heart
We think this Lailah does not exist in your camel-litter
Your ear is the seeker of the sound of bygone lyre
And your heart is unconcerned with today’s affairs
Your garden companions do not listen to the tale of roses
The assembly’s people do not listen to your old message
O bell of the sleeping caravan! Be quiet
Your call is very frustrating! Be quiet
That old assembly cannot be brought back to life
The yesternight cannot be illuminated with candle
O Companion ! I am a Muslim, I am the harbinger of Tawhad
Since eternity I am the sincere testifier of this Truth
The warmth in the pulse of the universe is from this
And the courage in the Muslim’s thought is from this
God created the universe for this Truth
And created me for its guardianship
I became the destroyer of false worship in the world
The truth is that I became the protector of Existence’ honor
My life is the cover for the world’s nakedness
My destruction is the disgrace of the human race
The Muslim is the shining star of the universe’s destiny
The spell of the morning by whose brilliance is shy
The secrets of life are open to my eyes
I cannot be considered lacking hope in the battle of life
How can the transient scene of grief frighten me
Confidence in destiny of my Millat strengthens me
My world is free of the component of despair
The zeal for battle gives the news of complete victory
Yes, it is true I keep my eye on the old times
I relate the old story to the assembly’s audience
Memory of the past age is the elixir for my life
My past is the interpretation of my future
I keep that pleasurable period before me
I see the tomorrow in the mirror of today
When I felt this ignoble strife of the world grievous
Packing up my goods and chattel I departed from the world
Though I did pass life within limits of morning and evening
I never got acquainted with the old system of the world
The angles took me to the assembly of the Holy Prophet
They took me to the audience of the symbol of God’s Mercy
The Holy Prophet said “ O nightingale of the garden of Hijaz!
Each flower-bud of yours is melted with your music’s warmth
Your heart is always ecstatic with the wine-cup of God’s proximity
Your supplication is the envy of prostrations in Divine Love
In your flight from the lowly world to the celestial world
The angels taught you the elegance of the flight
You have come like fragrance out of the world’s garden
With what gift for me have come you?”
“Sire ! Satisfaction on the earth is not available
The life I am searching for is not available
Thousands of tulips and roses exist in the garden of existence
The flower-bud with the fragrance of fidelity is not available
But I have brought a lover’s wine-glass as an offering
Whatever is in this even in paradise is not available
Glistens your Ummah’s honor in this
Blood of Tripoli’s martyrs is in this”
A leader of the nation once said to Iqbal
“A hospital is about to open in Jeddah for Hijaz
Every speck of your dust becomes restless
As you hear from somebody the tale of Hijaz
Move your hand of Love towards your pocket
You are world famous as the lover of Hijaz
The hospital in the suburbs of Baèha is needed
In the hands of ‘Isa the patient’s pulse is needed ”
I said “Life lies in the veil of death
As the Truth lies veiled in metaphors
What the Lover has obtained in the position of death
Khizar could not obtain in the wine of eternal life
Sir, convey this message of life to others
I am searching for death in the land of Hijaz
Why have you brought the message of cure?
What concern do Lovers have with the Masaha2
Whatever comes out of the heart is effective
It has no wings but has the power of flight
It has holy origins, it aims at elegance
It rises from dust, but has access to the celestial world
My love was seditious, rebellious and clever
My fearless wailing rent through the sky
On hearing it the sun said, “Somewhere there is somebody!”
The planets said, “At the ‘Arsh-i-Baran there is somebody!”
The moon was saying, “No, it is some inhabitant of the earth!”
The milky way was saying, “Somebody is concealed just here”!
If someone understood my Remonstrance Rizwan did
He understood me as the Man turned out of the Paradise !
Even angels exclaimed in surprise “What could this voice be!
Unknown even to the ‘Arsh’s keepers what the secret could be!
Is the mankind’s reach really even to the ‘Arsh?
Has this pinch of dust also learned flight?
How ignorant of good manners the earth’s denizens are!
How bold and insolent these denizens of the low are!
Is he so insolent that even angry with God he is?
Is he the same Man who once worshipped by angels was ?
He is the knower of Kamm and of the enigmas of Kaif
But, he is unacquainted with the secrets of modesty
Mankind are proud of the power of their rhetoric
These ignorant people are incapable of talking”!
A voice came “Very pathetic is your story
Full of restless tears is your wine-measure
Your ecstatic clamor pervaded the celestial world
How bold in speech is your Loving heart !
You sweetened the Remonstrance with elegant graces
You established intercourse between God and His people
We are inclined to Mercy, but there is no one to implore
Whom can we show the way ? There is no wayfarer to the destination
Jewel polishing is common, but there is no proper jewel
There is no clay capable of being molded into Adam
We confer the glory of Kai on the deserving
We confer even a whole new world on those who search!
Arms are feeble, hearts are accustomed to apostasy
The ‘believers’ are a source of disgrace to the Prophet
Idol-breakers have departed, the rest are idol-makers
Though the father was Ibraham the sons are Azar
The wine-drinkers, the wine, even the decanters are new
The sanctuary of the Ka‘bah, the idols, even you are new
There was a time when this alone was the source of Beauty
The wild tulip was the pride of the season of spring
Whichever Muslim there was, the Lover of God he was
A while ago your beloved this very Unfaithful was
Make the covenant of fealty now with some local one
Make the Ummah of the Holy Prophet a local one!
How difficult for you is waking up at the dawn!
You have no Love for Us, sleep is dear to you
Ramazan’s restriction is irksome to your free nature
You tell us ! Is this the appropriate rule of fidelity?
A nation exists on the din, you cease to exist if the din does not exist
Without mutual attraction the assembly of stars does not exist
You are the ones who do not know any art in the world
You are the nation which does not care for its nest
You are the harvest which harbors the lightning
You are those who sell their ancestors’ graves
As you have earned a good name by selling graves
Will you not sell if idols of stone you get?
Who effaced false worship from the face of the world?
Who rescued the human race from slavery ?
Who adorned my Ka‘bah with their foreheads in Love?
Who put my Qur’an to their breasts in reverence?
They were surely your ancestors, but what are you ?
Sitting in idleness, waiting for tomorrow are you !
What did you say? “For the Muslim is only the promise of houri
Even if the Remonstrance be unreasonable decorum is necessary
Justice is the Creator of Existence’ custom since eternity
When the infidel adopts Muslim ways he receives houris and palaces
Not a single one among you is longing for houris
The Effulgence of tur exists but there is no Musa
The gain of this nation is one, also the loss is one
Only one is the prophet of all, dan is one, Iman is one
The Holy Haram is one, God is one, Qur’an also is one
Would it have been very difficult for Muslims to be one
Sects abound somewhere and somewhere are castes!
Are these the ways to progress in the world?
Who is the renouncer of the laws of the Holy Prophet?
The criterion for whose actions is expediency of time ?
Who is enamored with the customs of the enemies
Whose thinking is disgusted with ancestors’ ways?
No warmth is in the heart, no feeling is in the soul
There is no respect for the message of Muhammad in you!
If some array themselves in mosques, it is the poor
If some endure the discomfort of fasting it is the poor
If some are reverent to Us it is the poor
If some hide your faults it is the poor
The rich in their arrogance of wealth are negligent of Us
The Millat-i-Baiza is alive on the strength of the poor
That mature thinking of the nation’s preacher is gone
That natural lightning is gone, fiery speeches are gone
The ritual of adhan has persisted, the spirit of Bilal is gone
Philosophy has persisted, the teaching of Ghazala is gone
Mosques are lamenting that the reciters of prayers are gone
That is those with attributes of Hijaz’ people are gone
Clamor is that Muslims have disappeared from the world
We ask whether the Muslims were present anywhere?
In fashion you are Christians, in culture you are Hindus
Are these Muslims ! Who put the Jews to embarrassment!
Sure, you are even Saiyyid, Mirza and Afghan also
You are all these, say whether you are Musalmans also?
During speech the candor of the Muslim was fearless
His justice was strong, undefiled by consideration of bias
The tree of Muslim’s nature was watered with modesty
In valor he was an incomprehensible existence
Internal warmth was the essence of his wine’s quality
To empty itself was the custom of his decanter
Every Muslim was a lancet for the vein of infidelity
Activism was the polish to the mirror of his life
Whatever trust he had, on his own strength it was
You are afraid of death, he afraid of God alone was
If the art of the father not well-known to the son be
How can the son worthy of the heritage of the father be!
Everyone is intoxicated with the wine of indulgence
Are you Muslims? To you is this the way of Islam?
You have neither the faqr of Haidar nor the wealth of Uthman
What spiritual relation between you and your ancestors exists?
They were respected in the world by being Muslims
And you became disgraced by abandoning the Qur’an
You are indignant to each other, beneficent they were
You are guilty and prying into guilts, forgiving and merciful they were
Though everybody wants to reach the zenith of Thurayyah
Every body must first cultivate that kind of affable heart
The throne of Faghfur was theirs, the crown of Kai also
Is this all mere empty talk or you have that ardor also?
You are self-destructive, zealous and self-respecting they were
You flee from brotherhood, lovers and brotherhood they were
You are head to foot talk, action incarnate they were
You tantalize for flower-bud, with garden in their lap they were
Even now nations remember their story
Impressed on existence’s sheet is their fidelity!
Like stars on the nation’s horizon you appeared also
In the Indian idol’s love you became a Brahman also
In the love for flying you became separated from the nest also
Indolent were the youth already, became suspicious of dan also
They have been freed from every restraint by ‘civilization’
Having been brought from Ka‘bah, they have been settled in the temple
Qais may not continue enduring hardships of seclusion in the wilderness
May stroll in the city, may not remain wandering in wilderness
He is insane, he may or may not in the city remain
It is necessary the Lailah’s veil may not remain
Let there be no wailing against ‘tyranny’ or complaint of ‘injustice’
Love is free, why should not the Beauty be free also?
The new age is a lightning, consuming every barn is
Safe from this no wilderness and no rose-garden is
Of this new fire old nations are the fuel
The Ummah of the last Prophet is set afire
If the Iman of Ibrahim is acquired even now
Fire can create the garden’s norm even now
The gardener should not be upset by seeing the garden’s state
Branches are about to appear from the bunches of buds
The garden will be cleared soon of the waste and trash
The red of the martyrs’ blood will be producing rose buds
Look a little the color of the sky somewhat red is
This the glowing of the horizon by the rising sun is!
Some nations in the existence’s garden benefited from their labors are
And some deprived of fruits and even destroyed by autumn are
Hundreds of trees deteriorated and hundreds flourishing are
Hundreds still even concealed in the bosom of the garden are
The tree of Islam a model of flourishing is
This the fruit of eons of gardening efforts is
Your skirt is undefiled by the dust of homeland
You are the Yusuf for whom every Egypt is Kan’an
It will never be possible to destroy your caravan
Nothing except the ‘Clarions’s Call’ are your chattel
You are a candle-like tree, in its flame’s smoke your roots are
Your thoughts free from the care of the end are
You will not be destroyed by the destruction of Iran
Wine’s ecstasy is not connected with its container
It is evident from the story of the invasion of Tatars
That Ka‘bah got protectors from the temple
You are the support of the boat of God in the world
The present age is night, you are a glimmering star
This tumult of Bulgaria’s invasion which is afoot
Is the message of awakening for the negligent
You think this is the plan for hurting your sentiments
This is a test of your sacrifice and your self respect
Why are you afraid of the hooves of the enemies’ horses ?
The enemies’ blows will be unable to extinguish the light of the Truth
Your potential is still hidden from the world’s nations
The assembly of existence still has need for you
The whole world is kept alive by your warmth
Your Khilafah is the star of the possibility’s destiny
There is no time for leisure, there is work to be done
Completion of the light of Tawhad is still to be done
Like fragrance you are contained in the flower-bud, become scattered
Become the chattel traveling on the wings of the breeze of the rose-garden
If you are poor, changed from speck to the wilderness be
From the melody of the wave changed to tumult of the storm be
With the Love’s power elevate every low to elegance
With Muhammad’s name illuminate the whole world
If there is no flower nightingale’s music should also not be
In the world’s garden smile of flower-buds should also not be
If there is no cup-bearer, wine, and decanter should also not be
Tawhad’s assembly in the world and you should also not be
The system of the universe is stable by this very name
The existence’ pulse is warm with this very name
In the wilderness, on the mountain-side, in the plains it is
In the ocean, in the lap of the wave, in the storm it is
In China’s city, in Morocco’s desert it is
And concealed in the Iman of the Muslim it is
The world’s eyes should witness this sight till eternity
The Elegance of the grandeur of “Rafa‘na Laka Zikrak” should see
The majority people, that is the non-white world
The world which would nurture your martyrs
The world reared by the sun, the crescent’s world
What the people of Love call the Bilal’s world
Is agitated like mercury by this name
Is diving in Light like the Beloved
Intellect is your shield, Love is your sword
My dervish ! Your viceregency is world-conquering
Your Takbar like fire for Godlessness is
If you are Muslim your prudence your destiny is
If you are loyal to Muhammad we are yours
This universe is nothing the Tablet and the Pen are yours
Everyone knows how to throw down people with intoxicants
The fun is to convert the intoxicated one to sanity, O cup-bearer
Those who were the old wine-drinkers are gradually departing
Bring the water of immortality from somewhere, O cup-bearer
Your whole night has passed in tumult and clamor
The dawn is close remember God, O cup-bearer!
Though we also are happy with the progress of the young
But some complaint from the happy lips also comes with it
We had thought education would bring economic freedom
We did not know that atheism would also come with it
Though Shirin did honor Parviz with her presence
But she brought the ax of Farhad also with her
Let us take the seed afresh in our hand and use it anew
We are ashamed to reap what would come out from whatever we sowed
The distinction between the ruler and the ruled cannot disappear
The beggar cannot have the audacity of being equal to the king
In the world adoration of the master is the climax of devotion
“Seek the pleasure of the master and have the beautiful tunic”
But if you aim to have the good pleasure of the ruler
You will have the title of self-seeker and anti-national
The old way has thousands of difficulties
In the new principle the lap is free of worries
The real joy comes by passing one’s life like this
“Thousand words in the mouth and have silent lips”
This principle alone is the mainstay of peaceful existence
“The recluse beggar you are, O Hafiï make no clamor”
But “If you are inclined to clamor let us begin
“Grasp holy wine, then drink it to the harp’s tune”
Join the assemblies of the rich, the minister and the king
Smash to pieces conscience’ goblet with greed’s stone
However, listen to the message of the Saint of Sharaz also
That this is the secret of the conscience seller’s closet
“Light of effulgence is the king’s brilliant opinion
If you want his closeness try to have clean intention”
The melodious brook is coming down from the mountain
After drinking red wine from the tavern’s spring
Just listen to the message of the ecstatic stroller
Only he is living who unconcerned with resting is
In the valleys the cloud’s elegant daughter is roaming
Exhibiting her love for the greenery of the meadow is
Stealing away the cup of wine from mountain’s tavern
Passing throughout ups and downs suckling the fields is
If the affectionate poet also exhibits the truth
Life’s cultivation greens up from his bountiful ways
Khalal’s glory is evident from his verse
When his nation exhibits the Azar’s ways
For earth’s inhabitants is the recipe of eternal life
The literature which is nurtured in sincere ways
If the book of literature’s wine in the world’s garden does not exist
The flower, the bud, the verdure, even the garden will not exist
When the dawn full of action arrives from the east
The silence marches off from the stage of life
The quietude of nature’s congregation ends at last
Everything presents evidence of its life at last
The birds warble on getting the message of life
In the garden flowers also put on the robe of life
O sleeping Muslim get up! You also engaged in action be
Look, the horizon has brightened up, you also busy in urgent tasks be
In the universe’s expanse a traveler like the sun be
So that the sky not producing these spots of clouds be
Pulling the dagger of sun’s ray get busy again in the fight
Again teacher of escape’s rules to falsehood’s darkness be
You are head to foot Light, manifestation makes you happy
And after being manifest spreading out is incumbent on you
Yes ! On being manifest become lightning to the bat’s eye
O hidden mystery of the heart of universe manifest be!
O Lord! To the Muslim’s heart grant that live Longing
Which may warm the heart, which may restlessness to the soul grant
Again brighten up every speck of dust of the Valley of Faran
Again Longing for the Spectacle, taste for the asking grant
Again to the one deprived of the Spectacle the discerning eye grant
Whatever I have seen, to others also its sight grant
Again guide the strayed away deer towards the Haram
To the one addicted to city, vastness of wilderness grant
Again in the forlorn heart create the Last Day’s tumult
Again to this empty camel-litter the lover of Lailah grant
In the darkness of this age to every perturbed heart
That mark of Love which may embarrass the moon grant
In elegance raise the Muslims’ goals to the level of Thurayyah
Self-respect of the ocean, freedom of the sea shore grant
Love should be pure, candor fearless should be
Grant Light to hearts, hearts like crystal grant
Grant the feeling for signs of the calamity
In today’s tumult concern for tomorrow grant
I am the wailing nightingale of a ruined rose garden
I am the supplicant for acceptance, O Benevolent one alms to the beggar grant
In the Shalamar Garden a yellowed leaf was saying
“Gone is that spring of which the confidante I am
The garden’s visitors should not trample me down
The memory of the branch of their own nest I am”
This tiny little leaf made the heart restless
One coming into the garden complete mourner of spring I am
In the autumn I am crying in remembrance of the spring
How can I get the happiness of Eid as grief-stricken I am
Devastated have become the olden days’ taverns
A memorial of the olden days’ wine drinkers I am
It gives the message of pleasure and happiness to us!
The crescent of Eid is making fun of us!
Fatimah ! The honor of the blessed Ummah you are
All specks of your handful of dust innocent are
O nymph of wilderness this happiness in your destiny was
Serving water to fighters against infidels your destiny was
This holy war in God’s cause without armaments is!
How courage-inspiring this desire for martyrdom is!
This flower-bud also in the autumn-stricken garden was!
O Lord! Such a spark also concealed in our ashes was!
In our wilderness many a deer still concealed is
Many a lightning asleep even in the rained out clouds is!
Fatimah ! Though in your grief the eye shedding dew is
The tune of pleasure also in our wailing of grief is
How pleasing the dancing of your dust is!
Every speck full of the warmth of life is
Some activity in your silent grave is
A nation being reared in this lap is
Though unaware of the extent of their aims I am
Their re-birth from this grave discerning I am
New stars appearing in the celestial space are
Whose light waves strange to the human eye are
Who just arisen from the dark house of time are
Whose lights unaware of limitations of day and night are
In whose brightness the old as well as the new ways are
And also the shadows of stars of your destiny are
One night stars started saying this to the dew
“Every morning new sights are available to you
Who knows how many worlds you have seen!
Relics of those who rose and fell you have seen
Venus has heard this news from an angel
That human habitation is very far from the sky
Tell us the tale of this beautiful realm
The ode of whose love the moon sings”
“O stars ! Do not ask me about the earth’s garden
A place of sighs and wailing it is, not a garden
The zephyr comes from there only to return
The poor flower-bud opens only to wither
What can I tell you how garden-brightening the flower-bud is
Some little flame without warmth the flower-bud is
The rose cannot hear the nightingale’s call
It cannot pick up the pearls from my skirt
The melodious birds are imprisoned, it is outrageous
The thorns grow just under the rose, it is outrageous
The eye of the sick narcissus always remains wet
The heart longs for sight, but the eye is sightless
The elm tree is tormented with the heat of complaint
The elm tree is nominally free but is really a prisoner
The stars are the sparks of sighs to the human eye
In the rose garden’s language I am only lament’s cry
Circumambulation of moon round the earth ignorance is
It thinks there the cure for its scar of Love is
The foundation of the world’s abode is in the air1
It is the picture of lament on the sheet of space !”
When the struggle between Truth and falsehood began in Europe
The Truth was compelled on wielding the dagger
The dust of the Cross circled round the Crescent
Shakree became besieged in the fortress of Adrianople
Provisions of Muslim soldiers became exhausted
The face of hope from the eye became concealed
At last by the Turkish army commander’s orders
“Martial Law” was proclaimed the law of the city
Everything was transferred to the army camp’s store
The eagle became beggar for the grain of the sparrow
But when the Faqah of the city heard this news
He exploded with anger like the thunderbolt of tur
“Dhimma’s “ wealth is forbidden for the Muslim army”
This edict was published throughout the whole city
The army would not touch the Jews’ and Christians’ wealth
The Muslim became compelled by the Command of God !
How cruel, tyrant and vindictive the Ruhalah was
He blinded the Mughal Emperor with the point of his dagger
The tyrant ordered members of the royal household to dance
This tyranny was no less than the Judgment Day’s signal
For the delicate ladies of the royal household it was
Utterly impossible to comply with this shameless order
Ah ! The merciless one made them the means of pleasure
Whose beauty had been veiled from sun’s, moon’s and stars
The feeble hearts were throbbing, the feet were forced to move
A river of blood was flowing from the wet eyes of the princesses
For some time his eyes remained thus absorbed in seeing
In confusion he freed his head from the load of Mighfar
He untied the deadly, fire-spitting sword from the waist
Whose sharpness was a source of luminescence to the stars
He put the dagger in front, and lied down in some thought
Sleep was demanding rest from the red eyes so to say
The water of sleep extinguished the embers of his eyes
The tyrant’s sight became ashamed of the painful spectacle!
He got up and started saying this to Taimur’s household
“You should have no complaint against your fate”
My sleeping in the couch was a mere show, an affectation
Because stupor is foreign to the dignity of fighters
It was my intention that some daughter of Taimur
Considering me unconscious might kill me with my own dagger,
But at last this secret has dawned to the whole world
Concern for honor has departed from Taimur’s household
A domesticated bird once said to the wild bird
“If you have wings, do not I also have wings?
If you are air-borne, I am also air-borne
If you are free I am also not a prisoner
All winged creatures are characterized by flight
Why then are wild birds inclined to be arrogant!”
As the wild bird’s self-respect became wounded
He spoke thus on hearing this heart-rending talk
“There is no doubt you also are free for flight
But the limit of your flight is only up to the wall
Are you unacquainted with the courage of the wild birds?
You live on the dust, they are concerned with the sky
You are a household bird, you seek food in the dust
We strike the star with our beak in search of the grain”
My eye is unacquainted with the taste for the Sight
Your eye is the knower of Nature’s secret, so what?
My tongue is indebted to the complaint against time
The universe’s rotation depends on your will, so what ?
The sky kept me wandering in garden like the breeze’s current
The sky has bestowed the abode over you, so what ?
The wealth of your life is free of desire for gain
In my heart is the anxiety of loss, so what ?
Your planes are flying about in the air
My ship is devoid of the sail, so what?
I became strong, so what , I became weak, so what?
This happened, so what , that happened, so what?
Tranquillity does not exist to any extent in this rose-garden!
If you became spring, and I became autumn, so what?
Your regard for the ways of the Lord of Yathrib is strange
Your life is exhibiting that you are not a Muslim
What made heavens contained in your ring’s circle
O Sulaiman ! that jewel is lost by your negligence !
That mark of prostration which used to shine like a star
Your forehead has now become unacquainted with that mark !
Just look at your actions, do you envisage
That candor whose fearlessness was always wonderful
Your ancestors’ eye was the thunderbolt for falsehood
The same falsehood is now lodged in your breast
O negligent one come and inhabit in your abode again
The discerning Kalam is singing on the spiritual tur
“You must be subservient to whom you had become rebellious
From wherever you departed like flame, turn back to it”
One day Iqbal said to the Muslim
“Your existence is unique in the universe
The tunes of your old songs are the basis of new knowledge
Civilization is the dust of your old caravans
Even the zephyr’s current is like stone to it
Very delicate is the mirror of Man’s honor
The men of action by discovering the causes of phenomena
Find the cure for the azure-colored sky’s cruelties
Ask them who are the old secret keepers of the garden
How the autumn became engaged in fight with your garden”
The Muslim became restless with my conversation
The sad sigh became betrayer of the inner sorrow
He said “Just look at the autumn’s condition
The leaves of the tree of life have become pale
Those garden’s secret keepers became silent
Whose tune of pathos was the means of mellowness
The garden’s inhabitants were still mourning Shibla
When Hala also became a traveler towards Paradise
“Still he is a fool who is asking the gardener
What did nightingale say, what did rose hear, what did zephyr do ?”
Struggle has continued from eternity till the present day
Between the lamp of Musèafa and the spark of Bu Lahab
Life is flame-tempered, high-minded and fervent
It’s nature is resolving difficulty, bearing cruelty
From the evening’s quietude till the morning’s song
There are many a stage of the midnight wailing!
Struggle exists between the heat and cold, throbbing and shaping
From the dark dust to the polished glass of Halab !
The phenomena of making and breaking, squeezing, heating and distilling
Exist between the drop of spring rain and the heat of the grape wine!
Nations live by this continuous struggle alone
This alone is the secret of the Arab nation’s struggle !
“The tavern-keepers making wine from the grape
Break the stars and construct the sun”
One day the Holy Prophet to his companions appealed
“All who have wealth should give some in God’s cause”
One hearing this command Umar rose in intense happiness
That day he had acquired several thousand dirhams
He was saying to himself that certainly that day
He would excel Siddaq by far that day
At last he brought the wealth before the Holy Prophet
Starting the action is a prelude to the necessary sacrifice
The Holy Prophet asked him, “O Umar!
To whom God’s Love is the solace of the heart!
Have you kept anything for the family?
Muslim is responsible for family’s rights”
He exclaimed “Half wealth is the son and wife’s share
The rest is made a present to the Ummah in sacrifice”
Soon after, that friend of prophethood also arrived
On whom the foundation of Love is established
That man of proved loyalty brought with him
Everything which is creditable in the world’s eye
All that right hand possessed, in cash, kind, chattel
Beautiful horses, camels, mules and donkeys
The Holy Prophet said, “You also need to care for the family”
Replied that secret-keeper of Love and Fidelity
“O you who give light to the eyes of the moon and the stars
Who was made the reason for creation of the universe
Lamp to the moth, flower to the nightingale is sufficient
For Siddaq only the Prophet of God is sufficient!”
Extremely excessive is the heat of current civilization’s wine
The clay body of the Muslim has exploded into flames
It made the speck into fire-fly by giving it borrowed light
Just look at what the trickery of the splendid sun is
The nature of the young generation has found new ways
This beauty, this alertness, this freedom, this fearlessness
Such a change has come about in planning and thought
Bursting of the garden’s flower-buds in Love is considered trivial
The newly flying birds have lost their nests but
A pretty sight has been shown by magician’s cunningness
The new life brought with it ever changing pleasures
Rivalry, selling conscience, impatience, greed
Muslim’s assembly is glittering with the new candle’s light
But my old time wisdom is saying this to the moths
“O moth! You have derived this warmth from the assembly’s candle
Burn in your own fire like me if you have the warmth of the heart
Every particle of the universe is a prisoner of destiny
Prudence is a cover for helplessness and compulsion
The sky, the sun and the moon all are helpless
The fast moving stars are compelled to moving
Breaking is the end of flower bud’s pitcher in the garden
The garden’s verdure and flowers are also compelled to grow
It may be nightingale’s song or conscience’ silent call
Everything is chained in the same universal chain!
When this secret of helplessness becomes evident to the eye
The turbulent flood of tears in the heart dries up
The dance of pleasure and grief does not remain in the human heart
The song remains but the pleasure of treble and bass does not remain
Knowledge and wisdom are robbers of tears and sighs’ wealth
That is the intelligent heart is a piece of diamond!
Though the dew’s freshness does not exist in my garden
My eye is not enriched with the red tears
Ah! I am aware of the secret of human afflictions
But my nature’s orchestra is unaware of complaint’s song
The story of vicissitudes of time does not come on my lips
My heart is not astonished, not laughing, not crying
But O messenger, your picture is one of constant wailing
Ah! this is the contradiction of my firm wisdom!
Life’s foundation becomes lasting with overflowing wailing
The hard hearted Intellect is embarrassed with the knowledge of pathos
My mirror is bright with the wave of sighs’ smoke
My skirt is full with the treasure of tears
The miracle of your picture has surprised me
Which has completely changed the flight of time
As if it brought the past and present together
It acquainted me again with the age of infancy
When that feeble soul was being nurtured by your side
Whose tongue was not adequately familiar with talking
And whose linguistic spice is now the subject of conversation
The pearls of whose jewel-shedding eyes are priceless
The learning’s serious discourses, the shrewdness of old age
The dignity of worldly honors, the pride of young age
We descend from the positions of dignity in life
We descend as a simple child in the lap of the mother
We are laughing informally, we are free from care
We are once more living in the same lost paradise
Ah! Who will now be waiting for me in the homeland?
Who will become restless by not getting my letter?
I will come to your grave carrying this lament
To whose thoughts will I come in the midnight prayers?
With your up-bringing I became fortunate like stars
The house of my ancestors became a source of pride
Your life was written in gold letters in the existence’ book
Your life was a full lesson of secular and religious education
Your love remained in my service for your whole life
When I was able to serve you, you did not survive
That youth who equals the slender cypress in stature
Who became more fortunate in serving you than me
That constant companion of mine in the business of life
That picture of yours in love, that source of my strength
He is crying like a helpless infant for you
He is crying with impatience from morning till evening
The love whose seed you planted in our life’s field
By the grief of separation that love became more firm
Ah! This world, this mourning place for the young and old!
In what a strange ever-changing prison man is imprisoned!
How difficult it is to live! How easy it is to die!
In the existence’ garden death is cheap as breeze!
There are earthquakes, thunderbolts, famines, afflictions
How diverse the daughters of the mother of time are!
In poor man’s hovel, in rich man’s mansion is death
In forest, house, city, garden, wilderness is death
Death is tumultuous in the silent ocean
Boats are drowned in the lap of death
Neither there is ability to complain, nor power of speech
Life nothing but is a yoke choking the throat
In the caravan nothing but bell’s wailing exists
Nothing except the valuable weeping eye exists!
However, this period of trial will also come to its end
Behind the sky’s nine orbits there are other orbits also
What if the tulips and roses in this garden are afflicted?
What if nightingales are compelled to wail and complain?
The bushes, which are burnt by the sighs of the autumn
Will green up when the breezes of the invigorating spring flow
What if our spark is asleep in the dust of the shield?
What if this handful of dust is our temporary abode?
The end of the fire of life is not in the ashes!
This is not the jewel whose destiny is breaking!
Life is such a beloved in the eye of Nature
Life’s preservation is in everything’s nature
If the death’s hand could efface life’s picture
The system of the universe would not have made it so common
If it is cheap then think that death is nothing
Just as there is no break in living by sleeping
Ah ! O imprudent one! Death’s hidden secret is something different!
The instability of the picture exhibits something different!
The picture of wind over water is sight’s paradise
By break in the restless wave it makes the bubbles
It conceals it again in the skirt of the wave!
How mercilessly it demolishes its own picture
If the wind could not create its bubble again
The wind would not have broken it so carelessly
What is the effect of this custom on the form of creation?
This is the proof of the power of wind over creation
If the existence’ nature be not in search of longing
It would never be in search of the better form!
Ah ! The restless mercury, the sky brightening stars
The heat of these sparks is obligated to the night
Their antiquity is bewildering to the Intellect
The history of the human race is a mere moment for them
Then this Man whose vision is directed to the celestial world
Who is more immaculate in his goals than qudsis
Who is lighted up like a candle in the assembly of Nature
In the expanse of whose nature celestial world is a mere dot
Whose ignorance is restless to know the Truth
Whose nail is the plectrum to the harp of existence
Is this flame inferior than the sky’s sparks even?
Is our sun less precious than the stars even?
The eye of flower’s seed is awake even under the soil
How restless for growth and development the seed is
The flame of life which is concealed in this grain
Is under compulsion for self-assertion and growth
Even with the grave’s cold it cannot become dispirited
Even by being buried under soil it cannot become cold!
Becoming a flower, it comes out of its grave
That is it gets the robe of life from its death
Grave is the organizer of its scattered powers
Which is throwing its rope-ladder round sky’s neck
Death is the name of the renewal of life’s taste
Behind the veil of sleep it is a message of awakening
The one accustomed to flight is not afraid of flight!
Death in this garden is nothing but readying for flight!
People say that the pain of death is incurable
Separation’s wound is cured with time’s salve
But the heart where the grief of the dead ones is living
Is free from the loop of the chain of morning and evening
Mourning’s wailing does not stop with the spell of time
Time is no salve for the wound of separation’s sword
When some sudden calamity befalls us
Tears come out of the eyes constantly
The heart becomes accustomed to wailing and complaint
The heart’s blood drips from the tearful eyes
Though Man is deprived of the power of patience
This sub-conscious feeling always exists in his nature
The essence of Man does not become annihilated
He disappears from sight but is not annihilated
The baggage of life is dust with the flame of grief
This fire is cooled with this subtle feeling’s water
Ah! This control of wailing is not negligence’ silence
This consolation is awareness, it is not forgetfulness!
When the dawn manifests itself from the east
It washes away the night’s stain from the world’s skirt
It clothes the melancholy tulip in red garb
It makes the silent bird intoxicated with music
The song is freed from the nightingale’s breast
The morning breeze is so full of hundreds of tunes
Those who in rose beds, mountains and brooks were sleeping
At long last in the morning the bride of life are embracing
If the law of life is that every night dawn be
Why the end of Man’s grave should not his dawn be
The net of my silvery imagination is universal
In which I have imprisoned your remembrance!
The affliction stricken heart is filled with your memory
As in the Ka’bah the expanse is filled with supplications!
The sequence of Divine commands which is called life
Its manifestations are covering myriad of unstable worlds
The ways of every stage of life are different
Hereafter also is a marshaling place of life!
Nothing is available there to the death’s field
But the climate is favorable for action’s seed
The light of nature is not imprisoned in body’s darkness
The expanse of the human thought is not so narrow
Your life was brighter than even the moon
Your journey was better than even that of the morning star
May your grave be bright like the dawn’s mansion
May this dusty bed-chamber of yours be light-filled!
May the sky be spraying dew on your grave!
May the freshly grown grass be guarding this house!
At the dawn when my eye was enjoying the panorama
I saw that a ray of the sun was wandering about
I asked the ray, “O head to foot restlessness!
What kind of restlessness your impatient life has!
Are you a small little lightning, which the sky
Is nurturing to fall on the harvest of nations
Is this a flash, or your eternal nature, what is it?
Is it a dance? wandering? seeking what is it?”
“A sea of tumults is asleep in my silent life
My existence has been nurtured by the morning’s breeze
My destiny keeps me constantly restless
Taste for enlightenment keeps me busy in seeking
I am not fire-brand lightning, though by nature fire I am
Message of awakening from the world-illuminating sun I am!
Becoming collyrium I shall enter the human eye
Whatever night had hidden I shall show to the eye
Among your ecstatics is there any seeker of prudence also?
Among the sleeping people is anyone with taste of awakening also?”
The imagination of ‘Urfa has created a mansion
Which has became the envy of Sana and Faraba
On the subject of Love he wrote such music
By which red tears are still available to eyes
One day my heart made this complaint at his grave
“Tunes of restlessness no longer come from world’s assembly
The disposition of the world’s people has changed so much
That such condition of restlessness has gone from the world
The midnight wailing of the poet is offensive to the ear
When assembly’s eye be unaware of pleasure of sleeplessness
How can somebody’s flame of lament remove darkness?
When the morning’s light is unwelcome for nightly worshipers”
Call came from grave “Reduce complaint against world’s people
‘Strike the tune harder if the taste for music has become low
Even if I have greed I do not have the strength for exertion
Acquiring position is connected with the taste for search
A thousand thanks to God that my nature is contentment
A thousand thanks to God that my mind is not mischievous
Cultivations of human hearts flourish with my writings
In the world I am creative like the ocean feeding cloud
Congratulations to you on these secrets of politics
As my finger nail by Love’s grace is breast-excoriating
Desire for audience with kings is a sign of lifelessness
This secret has been exposed by Hafiï of elegant poetry
“If you desire that you elevated to Khizar be
Hidden from Sikandar’s eye as immortality’s water be”
The nation did not care for the message of Gautam at all
The value of its own single pearl it did not appreciate at all
Ah! The unfortunate nation remained unaware of the call of the Truth
The tree is unaware of the sweetness of its own fruit
He exhibited whatever the secret of life was
But India proud of its visionary philosophy was
The assembly which could be illuminated by Truth’s light was not this
The rain of mercy did come but the soil was not suitable!
Ah ! India is a place of sorrow for the Shudra
This habitation’s heart is unaware of human sympathy
The Brahman is still intoxicated with the wine of arrogance
Gautam’s candle is alight in the assembly of strangers
However, the temple again became lighted after eons
The house of Azar became lighted with Ibraham’s light
At last the call of Tawhad rose from the Punjab again!
A perfect man roused India from its slumber again!
One day Iqbal questioned the Kalam of tur
“ O You whose foot-prints converted the Valley of Sinai into a garden!
The fire of Namrud is still ablaze in the world
Why your Love’s old fire has been hidden from the eye”?
The reply of Sinai’s Master was “If you are a Muslim
Leaving the Invisible do not become the lover of the visible
If you have taste for the visible you need the Faith of Khalal
Otherwise ashes are the adornments of your life
If you are Lover of the Invisible do not care at all
Set your lamp in the Valley of Faran and remain waiting
The visible’s glory is temporary, the Invisibile’s Majesty is permanent
This Truth has the body-and-soul connection with Love
What if the flame of Namrud is alight in the world
‘ The candle melts itself in the midst of the assembly
A righteous Western writer has written
Who was highly respected among the literateur
“Asia was the marshaling place of Sikandar of Rome
His status was More elegant than even the sky
History attests that in combat with the Romans
The claims of Porus and Dara were vain
At this emperor with the myriad-man army
The blue sky was looking with amazement
Today nobody knows him in Asia
Even the historian does not recognize him
But Bilal, that humble person with Negroid origin
Whose nature had been brightened by the Prophethood’s Light
The call whose custodian the breast of Bilal since eternity became
Subservient to which call emperors as well as the indigent became!
Which brings amity between the black and the red
By which the poor and the rich are placed together
That heart-melting song is fresh till the present age
Which the old sky’s ear has been hearing for centuries”
Iqbal ! This general blessing is due to whose love?
The Roman has perished, the Negro is immortal!
The preceptor’s teaching was, “O foolish Muslim!
“Necessary preparations are incumbent on the traveler
The world’s ways have changed, such changes have come that
Those who were invaluable once are not even saleable now
That bright flame of yours from which darkness escaped
Now is reduced to a spark, less bright than stars
Cease to be the Invisible’s Lover, be the visible’s lover
Now influence of the visible God is triumphant over nations
In this garden success for your efforts is not possible
Your snare is worn out and the fast-flying bird is clever
In this age education is the cure for nations’ maladies
Education is like a lancet for the diseased blood”
By the leader’s suggestions love of education developed in me
Obeying the command of Khizar is incumbent on the wanderer of the wilderness
But the discerning eye should see my misfortune
“Went to pull thorn from foot, the litter disappeared from the sight
One day the dew in the garden was saying to the flower bud
“I lived for a long time among the flower buds of Paradise
The condition of your garden is so elegant
The Paradise’s sight is concealed in my bewildered eye
I have heard that some princess is the ruler of this garden
With whose foot-prints the wilderness would produce flowers
Some day take me with you up to her palace
Take me concealed in your skirt like fragrance”
The flower bud said “On the throne is that princess of ours
By whose kick even stones become resplendent jewels
But your nature is bright and princess’ rank is elegant
It is not possible that you reach her in company with me
However you can reach up to our princess
By becoming the hot tear of some afflicted person
Her glance is the message of ‘Eid to the Muharram’s people
Turns the continuous tears of afflicted people into pearls
O Iqbal! In what a place you have constructed your nest
In this garden song is the prelude to nightingale’s disgrace!
Though you are planting the sparks of the Valley of Aiman
Sprouting of seed of Sinai is not possible in this soil
The bud cannot be a flower even with the force of breath
Where everything is devoid of the exigency of self-development
Outrageous that the nature of garden’s denizens is asleep
Neither old age’s heart is awake nor the youth is courageous
When the intelligent hearts fall asleep in breasts
For the singer sweet music is changed to poison
Fly away from this garden if music’s restraint is impossible
As better than this assembly is the seclusion of some wilderness
“Manifestation of Lailah is much better in wilderness
City’s strait is unable to contain wilderness’ beauty”
Hatif said to me that in Paradise one day
Sa‘da of Sharaz addressed Hala in this way
“O with the pearl of whose poetry’s sky-illuminating light
The falcon became companion of moon and stars’ light!
Relate to me what the story of the Indian Muslim is
Is he lagging at the halt or busy in exertion is?
Is some warmth of dan left in his veins?
The heat of whose call was once burning the sky”
Hala was moved by the talk of the Shaikh
He started weeping and saying, “O man of miracles!
When the sky turned over the leaf of time
The call came that respect was possible only with education!
But this has produced wavering in fundamental beliefs
Secular benefits were obtained, but dan had been undermined
Goals also become exalted if the dan is preserved
The youth’s nature is paralyzed and very low keyed
Concordance among individuals is kept only with dan
Dan is the plectrum if national congregation is the musical instrument
If the foundation of the garden’s wall is shaken
It is clearly the beginning of the garden’s end
As the water of Zamzam was not available to it
Some manner of atheism is appearing in the new progeny
Do not talk of this in the audience of the Lord of Yathrib
Lest Muslims of India consider that this is my back-biting”
Dates cannot be obtained from the weeds we have sown
Brocade cannot be obtained from the wool we have spun”
The teaching of the sage of Western philosophy is
“Those seeking the Invisible Existence are ignorant
If the form is unfamiliar to sight
Would the Shaikh also be an idol-maker like Brahman?
The foundation of modern knowledge is on the tangible
In this age the wine-bottle of Faith is shattered
What is known as dan is an immature frenzy
Which is repulsive to human imagination”
But the philosophy of life is saying something else
This secret has been divulged to me by the Perfect Preceptor
“With every perfection a little distress is welcome
However, perfect the Intellect, it is not good without Love”
The armed Arab youth were arrayed for battle
The bride of Syria’s land was waiting for myrtle
A young man who was restless like mercury
Approaching the army’s general started saying
“O Abu ‘Ubaidah grant me permission to fight
The cup of my patience and calm is full
I am becoming impatient in the Holy Prophet’s separation
In his Love even a moment’s life has become hard
As I am going to the Holy Prophet’s audience
I shall gladly convey if there is any message”
The general’s eye, whose sight was like an un-sheathed sword,
Noticing this zeal and fervor was moist with tears
The army’s general exclaimed., “You are that young man
The respect for whose Love is binding on the elders
May the God of Muhammad fulfill your wish
How elegant is the stage of your Love!
When you arrive in the audience of the Holy Prophet
Present this petition with my sincere compliments
“The Exalted God has shown His Mercy to us
Have been fulfilled all the promises you had made to us”
Judge not your nation on the criteria of Western nations
Special in composition is the Hashima Prophet’s nation
Based on country and race is their organization
The force of dan stabilizes your organization
If the dan’s skirt is lost, disappears the organization
And if organization departs also disappears the nation!
The branch of the tree which got separated in autumn
Is not possible to green up with the cloud of spring
The autumn season for this branch is ever-lasting
It has no connection with flourishing in the spring
Autumn season prevails in your rose garden also
The pocket of the rose is devoid of good cash
The birds which were singing in the seclusion of leaves
Have departed from your shady tree’s leaves
You should learn a lesson from the separated branch
As you are unacquainted with the customs of the world
Keep very strong communication with the nation
Remain attached to the tree and have spring’s expectation!
This call of the evening star is coming from the sky
“This is the night before which the dawn prostrates
“For courage the ‘Arsh-i-Baran is only a pace away”
The Mi‘raj’s night is saying this to the Muslim
O flower! Why do you care for the nightingale’s wounded heart
First you should darn the slits of your own shirt!
If you long for respect in the rose garden of existence
You should get accustomed to living entangled in thorns!
The juniper in the garden is free as well as chained to the soil
You should acquire freedom within these constraints!
With contentment give message of embarrassment to miserliness
Do not remain obliged to dew, you should empty the cup and the bottle!
It does not befit self respect that being picked from the garden
You should be put in some turban or pinned to some collar!
The dew disappeared from garden saying to the flower bud
If you love gardener’s oppression, you should create beauty
If you want to remain unacquainted with autumn
First you should abandon the desire for the beauty’s world
Look, in this alone is concealed your life’s perfection!
If you should be the decoration of some beauty’s robe!
To the dawn’s twilight the river’s graceful flow is a mirror
To the evening’s song the evening’s silence is a mirror
To the spring’s beautiful cheek flower petal is a mirror
To the lover of wine the cup’s cavity is mirror
Beauty is God’s mirror and heart is Beauty’s mirror
To the human heart the beauty of your marks is a mirror
By your heaven-embracing thought is the perfection of existence
Was your bright nature the aim of existence?
When the eye searching for your sight sought you
It saw the sun veiled in the brightness of the sun
Your existence surely remained veiled from the world’s eye
And your eye saw the world completely unveiled
Nature has such a strong desire for guarding secrets
That another confidante like you it will never create!
Neither I have Kalam’s knowledge nor you have Khalal’s manners
I am destroyed by Samira’s magic, you are the victim of Azar’s method!
I am the scalded, unsung song, you are the faded color, the departed fragrance
I am the tale of grief’s longing, you are the narration of love’s mourning!
My grief is pleasure, my poison is honey, my existence is companion of annihilation
Your heart is Haram, captivated by the ‘Ajam, your dan has been purchased by infidelity!
Loss of life is its essence, concern for life is its poison
Do not be sad for loss, do not take grief’s poison as this is the way of qalandara!
Do not care for poverty and affluence, if your dust has a spark
Because in the world Haider’s strength depends on bread of Sha‘ar
O Haram’s lamp tell me some such method of circumambulation
Which would again grant to your moth the same salamander’s nature!
The complaint of friendly cruelty which the Haram has against its people
If I relate in some temple even the idol would call out “Hari Hari”
Neither the world’s battle-fields nor the arm-twisting enemies are new
The nature of Asad-ul-Laha as well as Marhaba and ‘Antara are the same
Mercy ! O Arab and ‘Ajam’s Lord as waiting for benevolence are

Imprisonment enhances confidence if the nature is elegant
The spring drop becomes blessed inside the shell’s prison
The excellent musk is nothing but a drop of blood
Which becomes musk when it is enclosed in the deer’s navel
However, not everyone gets trained by nature
Only an odd bird is prosperous in imprisonment
“Strength of crow’s and kite’s wing is not in cage and prey
This grace is reserved for the falcon and the eagle”
If the territory is being lost let it be lost
You should not be disloyal to God’s commands
Do you not have knowledge of history?
You have started begging for the Khilafah!
If we do not purchase with our own blood
Such sovereignty is a disgrace to the Muslim!
“I do not feel as much ashamed of being broken down
As in asking others for màmiya’a for my treatment”
O Humayun ! your life was full of warmth
Your spark was an assembly-enlightening lamp
Though your earthly body was slim and weak
Your elegant disposition was bright like a star
How fearless a heart in this frail body was
A universal flame in this handful of dust was!
But the intelligent heart was not at all afraid of death
In night’s silence there is nothing except morrow’s affairs!
The imprudent ones consider death is the end of life
This apparent evening of life is the morning of perpetual life!
One night at the river-bank I was absorbed in contemplation
With a world of restlessness concealed in the heart’s recesses
The night was tranquil, air calm, river gently flowing was
My eye was amazed whether the river or a picture of water it was!
As the suckling baby falls asleep in the cradle
The restless wave had fallen asleep somewhere else!
With the spell of night the birds were confined in nests
The twinkling stars were caught in the moon’s spell!
Suddenly I saw that the globe-trotting Khizar
Whose old age contained youth’s color like dawn
Was saying to me “O seeker of the eternal secrets
If the inner eye be open world’s destiny would be unveiled”!
On hearing this an uproaring tumult rose in my heart
Being devoted to seeking the Truth I started talking thus
“O you whose world-encompassing eye sees those storms
Whose tumults are still sleeping quietly in the river
The “indigent’s boat” the chaste soul , the “orphan’s wall”
Even the knowledge of Musa before you is in amazement
Leaving habitations you remain wandering in wilderness
No day and night, no yesterday and tomorrow is in your life
What is the secret of life? What is imperialism ?
And what is this struggle between labor and capital ?
The ancient patched garment of Asia is being torn
The youth of parvenu nations are adorned with ornaments !
Though Alexander remained deprived of eternity’s water
The nature of Alexander is busy still in merry-making!
The Holy Prophet’s progeny is selling his dan’s honor
And the struggling Turk is smeared in dust and blood !
There is fire, there is Ibraham’s progeny, there is Namrud !
Does someone desire someone’s test again
THE RESPONSE OF KHI¿AR
Wandering in Deserts
Why are you amazed at my wandering in the deserts ?
This incessant toil is demonstration of life
O the one confined to home, you have not seen that sight
When the call for battle march resounds in the desert air!
That care-free stroll of the deer on the mound of sand
That home without chattel, that journey without distance and destination!
That appearance of the fast-moving star at the dawn
Or the forehead of Jibra’al manifest from the sky!
That setting of the sun in the silence of the desert air
By which increased the insight of Khalal’s universe-envisaging eye !
And that halting of the caravan at the stream bank
As the believers’ gathering round the Salsabal !
The ardent Love is in search of an ever new wild land
And in city your effort is in farming and horticulture
The cup of life becomes more mature by revolving
O negligent one, this alone is the secret of life’s permanence!
Life
Much above the fear of profit and loss is life!
Now the soul now the surrender of soul is life!
Do not measure it on the scale of today and tomorrow
Eternal, incessantly struggling, ever young is life!
Create your own world if you claim to be among the living
The secret of Adam and the object of “Kun fikan” is life
Ask the mountain digger for the reality of life
The canal of milk, the axe, the heavy rock is life
In slavery it is choked to a mere trickling brook
And in freedom like the boundless ocean is life
It is manifested by its power of subduing
Though concealed in a body of dust is life
You have emerged from the existence’ ocean like a bubble
In this losing battle your examination is life
While you are immature only a heap of dust you are
On attaining maturity a merciless sword you are!
The heart which is restless for death in defense of Truth
Should first life in his own body must create
Should burn down this borrowed universe
And from the ashes his own universe should create
Should demonstrate the potential power of life
So that this spark may the eternal light create
Should shine like the sun over the lands of the East
So that Badakhshan the same invaluable rubies may again create
Should send heaven-ward the emissary of nightly wailing
And in the night’s stars its confidantes should create
This is the hour of Judgment you in the Judgement’s field are
O negligent one, present actions if some in your treasure are!
Imperialism
Come, I shall tell you the secret of the verse “Inn al-muluk”
Imperialism is an enchantment of the victorious nations
If the ruled from his stupor slightly wakes up
The ruler’s spell lulls him back to sleep again
From the effect of the spell of Mahmud the eye of Ayaz
Sees the accouterments of loveliness round his neck
At last the blood of Isra’al boils up with anger
The spell of Samira is smashed up by some Musa
Sovereignty befits only that Peerless Essence
Only He is the sovereign, the rest are Azar’s idols
Do not disgrace your independent disposition with slavery
So that you do not mold yourself into the master who would be a worse infidel than the Brahman
The Western democratic system is the same old orchestra
In whose frets is nothing different from the Qaisar’s tune
The monster of despotism is treading in democracy’s robe
You consider it as the beautiful ferry of independence!
The legislative assembly, the reforms, the rights and concessions
In Western medicine the tastes are sweet, the effect is soporific!
May God protect us from the fervor of speeches of members of assemblies
This also is the capitalists’ sham quarreling to deceive the poor!
You have taken this apparent beauty’s mirage as a garden!
Ah ! O ignorant one! You have taken the cage to be the nest!
Capital and Labor
Go and deliver my message to the laboring person
“Not only Khizar’s message, this is the universal message!
O whom the fraudulent capitalist has destroyed
Your destiny has remained a fugitive for centuries
The wealth-creating hand had been paid wages
As the rich pay charity to the poor!
The magician of Alamut gave you the hashash leaves
And you, O negligent one, took it as a tuft of candy!
Race, nation, church, empire, civilization, color
This assortment of intoxicants is made by “imperialism”
The ignorant one gave up his life for mythical gods
You destroyed your life’s capital under intoxicants’ love
The capitalist has won with deceitful stratagems
Due to extreme naivete the laborer is checkmated
Rise, as the world’s assembly has adopted different ways
In the East and the West is the beginning of your age
Those with elegant courage do not accept even the ocean
O negligent one, how long would you hold dew in your skirt like the flower bud?
Music of masses’ renaissance is a means of pleasure
The soporific tale of Alexander and Jam how long ?
A new sun has arisen from the bowels of the earth
O Sky ! Mourning of stars which have set how long?
Human nature has broken down all the chains
Man’s eye would weep for the lost Paradise how long?
The spring says this to the helping gardener
You would apply ointment to the rose’ wounded heart how long?
O simple fire-fly, be free of revolving round the candle
And be living in the illuminated place of your own nature!
The World of Islam
Why are you relating to me the story of Turks and Arabs
Nothing of the grief and joys of Muslims is hidden from me
The sons of the Cross have taken away the heritage of Khalal
The soil of Hijaz has become the brick of the church’s foundation!
The red cap has become disgraced in the world
Those who were formerly proud are in need of others!
From the wine sellers of Europe Iran is purchasing
That strong wine by whose heat the decanter is melted
The politics of the West has reduced the nation such
As gold is rendered to pieces by scissors
The blood of the Muslim has become cheap like water
You are restless as your heart is unaware of their fate
Rumi 35 said that every old building that is to be rebuilt
Do you not know that the building is first demolished ?
“The homeland has been lost, the nation has been jolted
O negligent one, look deep as God has granted you insight!
Defeat is better than helplessly begging for màmiya’a
O helpless ant ! Do not take your requests to a Sulaiman
The salvation of the East is in organization of the Muslim nations
The people of Asia are still unaware of this mystery
Relinquishing “politics” enter the fort of dan again
Country and wealth is only a reward for Haram’s defense
The Muslims should unite into one body for Haram’s defense
From the banks of the Nile to the City of Kashghar !
Whoever would discriminate for color and race would perish
Whether he be the tent-dwelling Turk or the high ranking Arab !
If race would become more important than dan to the Muslim
He would be blown away from the world like the dust of the road!
To establish the Khilafah’s foundations in the world again
The need is to bring from somewhere the ancestors’ mettle
O You who do not distinguish between the tangible and the intangible, beware
O the captive of Abu Bakr and ‘Ala, beware ”
Sha‘ir ( The Poet )
Complaint was incumbent on Love and it has been lodged
With a cool heart now watch the effect of the complaint!
You have witnessed the zenith of the majesty of the river’s flow
Now watch how the restless wave becomes a chain in which it gets entangled
The dream of universal freedom which was seen by Islam
O Muslim, you should watch the interpretation of that dream today!
Its own ashes are a means of existence to salamander
You should watch the resurrection of this world after death!
With open eyes in the mirror or my discourses
You should watch a faint image of the coming age
The sky has one more tested trick preserved in its store
Watch the disgrace of planning in face of destiny’s strength
You are a Muslim keep your breast happy with Longing
Every moment keep your eye on “La yukhlif-ul-Ma’ad”
The fading glitter of stars is the signal of a bright dawn
The sun has risen from the horizon, the time of deep stupor is gone!
Life-blood has started flowing through the dead arteries of the East
This secret is incomprehensible to Sana and Faraba !
The storm of the West has made the Muslim into a real Muslim
Only the upheavals of the sea bring the pearl’s beauty to its perfection
The Muslim is to be endowed again from the God’s Court with
Turkoman’s dignity , Indian’s intellect , Arab’s eloquence
If some slumber is lurking still in the flower buds
“Strike the beat harder if the taste for music is lacking”
Jump restlessly in the garden, in the nest, in bowers
It is impossible to deprive mercury of its restlessness
Why should the eye used to chaste things see coat of arms
When it is able to see the valor of the Ghaza’s soul!
O God, light the candle of Longing in the tulip’s heart
Make every speck of garden’s dust a martyr searching for the Truth
The effect of spring showers exists in the Muslim’s tears
Pearls are to be produced again in the ocean of Ibraham
The Book of the Muslim nation is being organized again
This Hashimite Branch is going to blossom again!
The beloved of Shiraz has won the hearts of Tabriz and Kabul
The zephyr produces its fellow traveler from rose’ fragrance!
The avalanche of calamity over Uthmanis is not to be bereaved
As the dawn is produced after destruction of myriad’s of stars!
Insight into the world is more difficult than the world’s sovereignty
Insight is produced only when the heart melts into blood!
For thousands of years narcissus bemoans its lack of luster
The discerning person is produced in the garden with difficulty
Sing O Nightingale so that with your modulations
The falcon’s heart in the pigeon’s frail body be produced
Concealed within your heart is the secret of life
Relate to the Muslim the traditions of pathos of life
You are the potent hand and the word of the Eternal God
O imprudent one! Develop Faith as you have been overcome with doubts
The Muslim’s destination is beyond the azure colored sky
You are the caravan the dust of whose trail are stars!
The house is ephemeral, the dweller is momentary, yours are the Beginning and the End
You are the Final Message of God and you are eternal!
Your life-blood adorns with myrtle the bride called tulip
Your origin is from Ibraham, you are the world’s architect!
Your nature is the custodian of all life’s possibilities
So to say you are the touch-stone for world’s hidden jewels!
From the material world to the Eternal world
You are the gift which the Holy Prophet took!
The history of the Muslim nation reveals the secret
That you are the protector of the nations of Asia
Learn again the lesson of Truth, Justice, and Bravery
You are to be entrusted with the world’s leadership!
This alone is the creation’s objective, this alone is Islam’s secret
That there should be universal brotherhood, abundant love!
Breaking the idols of race and color merge into the millat
There should be neither Turanian , nor Iranian, nor Afghanian!
How long the companionship of garden’s birds inside the garden’s confines?
Your wings are capable of the flight of Quhistan’s falcon!
In the world of existence full of doubts, the Muslim’s Faith
Is like a beacon of light in the dark night of the wilderness’
What could demolish the grandeur of Qaiser and Kisra ?
Nothing but Haider’s prowess, Bu Dhar’s faqr , Salman’s truth
With what dignity did the free men of the millat march out?
The centuries-old prisoners are only watching the spectacle through door’s crevices!
Stability of life in this world is bestowed by firm Faith
The Turanian has proved even longer lasting than the German
When Faith is created in this earthly ember
It itself creates wings and plumage of Jibril!
Neither swords nor plans are of any avail in slavery
Chains are cast away when taste for Faith is created
Can anyone assess the strength of his arms?
Destinies are changed by the Believer’s mere glance!
Sainthood, sovereignty, the universality of material knowledge
What are all these except unraveling of the secrets of Faith!
It is however difficult to develop Ibraham’s vision
Greed creates subconscious images stealthily in the vision!
The ruled and ruler’s discrimination is the bane of humanity
Beware, O oppressors the punishments of God for this are severe!
The essence of everything is the same, be it of dust or light
Sun’s blood would drip by cutting the core of dust’s speck
Firm Faith, constant struggle, Love, conquest of the universe
These are the swords for the brave men in the battle of life
What is expected from the brave? High disposition, sincere creed
Warm heart, immaculate vision and restless soul!
Those who had attacked like eagle emerged as wingless
The evening stars after diving into dusk’s blood emerged shining!
Those accustomed to swimming under the sea were buried under the sea
Those who bored ocean waves’ dashes emerged as pearls!
Those who were proud of alchemy are like the way side dust
Those who humbly prostrated before God emerged as elixir makers !
Our slow-moving messenger has brought the message of life
Those who got electric messages emerged as uninformed !
The Haram has been disgraced by the priests’ short-sight
With what excellent insight the Tatar youth have come out !
Angels, the denizens of celestial world, were saying to the earth
These earthly men emerged more lively, more virulent, more splendid!
The men of Faith live in the world like the sun
Set here, come out there, set there, come out here !
The individual’s Faith is the means of national renaissance
This is the force which shapes the nation’s destiny!
You are the secret of Kun Fikan , be manifest to yourself
Become the knower of the secret of Khuda, become interpreter of God
Human greed has torn the human race into pieces
Be the declaration of fraternity, become the language of Love
This is Indian, that Khurasanian, this Afghanian, that Turanian is
O you disgraced by nationalism, jump out and become boundless
Your wings and plumage are polluted with race and color’s dust
O Haram’s bird flutter your wings before you become ready for flight
O imprudent one! Dive in Khuda , this is the secret of life
Relinquishing the narrow confines of time become eternal
In the battle of life acquire the nature of steel
In the Love’s bed-chamber become soft like silk
Transcend mountains and deserts like a furious flood
If there be a garden in your path, become a melodious brook
The bounds of your Knowledge and Love are none
Melody sweeter than you in the Divine orchestra is none!
Humanity is still the helpless prey to imperialism
Outrageous that Man is the hunter of the human race!
The glitter of modern civilization dazzles the eye
But this is the luster of unreal jewels only!
The science which was the pride of the West’s sages
Is the battle-sword in the blood-stained clutches of greed!
The magic of prudence cannot make stable
The civilization which is based on capitalism
Dynamism establishes life; bestows heaven as well as hell
This earthly creature in its nature is neither angelic nor infernal
Partake the nightingale’s clamor, open the flower bud
As your person is the spring breeze for this garden
The spark of Love has again risen from the Asia’s heart
The world is the parading ground of the satin-clad Tatars
Come, a purchaser has appeared for this frail soul
“After a long time a caravan has arrived at our place”
Come, O cup-bearer, the sad bird’s music is coming from the bower
Spring has come, the beloved has come, as the beloved has come tranquillity has come!
The spring cloud has established its camp up hill and down dale
The sound of waterfalls from the mountain tops has come!
I have surrendered my life to you, O cup-bearer, you should also sing the future’s songs
Because in rows after rows groups of singing birds have come!
Withdraw from the ascetics and fearlessly draw the wine cup
After long nightingale’s song from this old branch has come!
Narrate to Lovers the traditions of Badr and Hunain’s Master
His hidden meanings clear to my eyes have become !
The other branch of Khalal is greening up with our blood
In Love’s market-place our currency full value has become
I am sprinkling tulip petals at the martyr’s grave
As his blood favorable to our nation’s sapling has become!
“Come, so that we may sprinkle flowers and pour wine in cup
Rend asunder the sky’s roof and establish a new foundation”
O zephyr! Convey my message to the one wrapped in blanket
The poor Ummah has lost both dan and material resources
The river bank gave this message to the restless wave
“Union with ocean is still far and you have already lost patience in the river”
O Qais! Love’s honor is made durable with litter’s curtain
If litter is lost, glory, honor as well as Lailah is lost!
Though the drop got pearl’s dignity by abandoning struggle
It lost taste for wandering and struggle in the river
Though this voice has emerged from Iqbal’s lips its source is unknown
The assembly got hope’s message as well as became restless for activism
These songs of turtle doves and nightingales are merely ear’s illusion
Behind this uproar the world of the garden is silent
O Western wine the effect of your goblets is only this
That cup-bearer is laughing and the entire assembly is unconscious
In the world’s sorrowful house you are not traceable
Was creation also a crime so Your nature is concealed ?
Ah! What the world considers heart is not heart
In the human breast this is a silent tumult
Walk on the path of life but walk carefully
Understand that some glass work is on your shoulders
Through whom Delhi and Lahore were drawn together
Ah! Iqbal that nightingale is silent now
O dejected nightingale your lament is immature still
You should hold it in your breast for a little while still
If Intellect is prudent it is considered mature
If Love is prudent it is considered immature still
Love fearlessly jumped into the fire of Namrud
Intellect is absorbed in the spectacle from roof-top still
Love moves fast in action under the messenger’s precept
Intellect has not even understood the Love’s message still
The way of Love is freedom and world revolution
You are imprisoned in day and night’s temple still
On the plea of temperance the cup-bearer says rudely
In your heart is the same anxiety for the end still
Constant struggle is the measure for life’s Kamm and Kaif
Your measure is the counting of days and nights still
O spring rain! How long this miserliness?
The tulips of my hillside are thirsty still
They are accustomed to `Ajam’s wine I have the `Arab wine
My cup makes wine-drinkers startled still
Zepheyr has brought news about Iqbal from the garden
The newly seized is writhing under the net still
Lift the veil from Thy Face and be manifest in the assembly
Make the eyes of the sun, moon and stars Thy spectators
If Thou art the lightning how long this secret winking?
Make acquaintance with my heart without a veil
The warm breath’s effect is the miracle of life
If it is on Thy breast perform life-giving miracles
How long should begging be on the tur like Kalam!
Make the flame of Sinai manifest with Thy Existence
Let the Haram be built with every speck of Thy dust
Make the heart alien to the ways of the Church
It is not good to exceed limits in this garden
If Thou showeth elegance make its show with grace
First become self-respecting like Alexander
Then make the show of desire of Dara’s grandeur
You will reach the destination of Lailah one day, O Iqbal
For some more days continue wandering in the wilderness
The spring breeze is flowing again start singing, O Iqbal
If you are a bud be the flower, if a flower the garden become
You are a handful of dust , with the warmth of the components
Wander around, scatter about and wilderness in extent become
You belong to the essence of Love, you are invaluable
The purchasers are indigent, low priced in this country become
Why should your tunes be veiled in the guitar’s frets?
You are an ornamented song, evident to every ear become
O wise traveler! If in your path you encounter
The garden become dew, if wilderness the storm become
Indulgence is concealed in the love of opulence
If you aim at the destination, destroyer of opulence become
O the much sought after Reality! Some time appear in material form
As innumerable prostrations restless in my humble forehead are
Join the assembly’s celebrations, You are a song, be heard
What good are melodies which veiled in guitar’s frets are
Do not jealously protect them , your mirrors are the mirrors
Which would be dearer in the Maker’s eye if they broken are
During circumambulation the moth exclaimed, “Those past effects
Neither in your story of pathos, nor in my tale of love are”
My wretched sins could not get shelter anywhere except
When they in the shade of Thy Gracious Forgiveness were
Neither Love has that warmth nor Beauty has that humor
Neither that restlessness in Ghaznavi nor those curls in the hair locks of Ayaz are
Whenever I went into prostration a voice came from the earth
Your heart is in materialism no rewards for your prayers are
No wonder if the garden birds remained fond of poetry even under the net
The lament fluttering in hearts as silent song remained
Thy Effulgence could not satisfy the restless heart at all
The same dawn’s lament remained, the same midnight sighs remained
Neither God, nor idols nor the rivals of temple and the Haram remained
Neither ‘Ali’s prowess nor Abu Lahab’s infidelity remained
Though my orchestra remained oppressed by `Ajam’s plectrum
I am that martyr in fidelity’s cause whose song ever Arabic remained!
Though you are bound by cause and effect
Keep your heart a little independent
Intellect is not free from criticism
Establish the foundation of your deeds on Love
O Muslim always in your mind
Keep the verse “La Yukhlif ul ma ‘ad”
This is the message of the Voice of Time
Always deep in heart “Inna wa`d-Allah i Haqqun”
In the East principles are changed to religion
But in the West they are changed into machines
We do not retain even one of them
There one is changed into three
The girls are learning English
The nation prosperity’s way has found
The ways of the West are in view
Eastern ways sinful are found
What scenes will this drama produce?
On curtain’s rising this will be found
The Shaikh also is not a supporter of women’s seclusion
The college boys unnecessarily suspicious of him became
He clearly stated in the sermon yesterday
“From whom would women be secluded if men women became”
O wise man! This is a matter of a few days only
Neither you will be modest nor woman will seclusion want
That time is approaching when instead of children
Votes for the council’s membership will she want
Western education is very encouraging
Its first lesson is to brag sitting in the college
As only the purchasers inhabit India
Afghans also bring assafoetida from their country
My condition is that I lick the toe of the boot
She says “Beware do not be crawling on my carpet”
The camel is said to be a somewhat clumsy animal
The cow is good as she has slender horns
It does not matter if the preacher is poor
He should bend to the new civilization
Much has been written on cancellation of jihad
He should write a tract on cancellation of hajj
The patient of civilization will not be cured by the gàla
For curing of the malady you should present him with pill
There was a time when in exchange for the teacher’s services
One wanted that the gift of the heart he should present!
Times have changed so much that the pupil after the lesson
Says to the teacher “You should present the bill”
Will there be an end to this, how long should we buy
Umbrellas, handkerchiefs, mufflers, shirts from Japan
If this condition of our complacence continues
Washers of the dead will come from Kabul, shrouds from Japan
We poor Easterners have been entangled in the West
All crystal decanters are there, only an old earthen jar is here
All will be annihilated in this age except the one
Who established in his ways and firm in his thought is
O Shaikh and Brahman do you listen to what people with insight say?
Heaven from great heights has thrown down those nations
Who formerly had assemblies of affection with firm love
Now under discussion is Urdu and Hindi or Dhibh and Jhatka
“The search, the witness and the thing witnessed are the same”
If this saying of Ghalib is true there is no strangeness
O Shaikh! Have you heard something?
What the temple’s people’s say to the Ka`bah’s people!
“We ask the Muslim with the disposition of a lover
If you love the idols why is enmity with the Brahman?”
We have lost all material resources
The thought of Judgment Day has gone also
The Shaikh was fighting for Endowment Acts
Ask him if there is any property left for endowment also?
As I tried to commit suicide the Miss exclaimed
“O lover! If you are civilized do not transgress the limits
Without courage or dagger suicide’s intention is strange
Even granting your pain of failure has exceeded the limits”
I said, “O dear, give me some cash
I shall hire some Afghan from the Frontier Province”
So naive were they not to appreciate the Arabs’ worth
What they got was that assault and battery they escaped not
In the West camel is called ship of the desert
The Turks made use of this fleet not
In India councils are a part of the government
This is the start of our political perfection
We were always beggars ,begging was our way
The rich should now acquire the skill of “begging”
Membership of the Imperial council is not at all difficult
Votes will be available; Will we be paid money also?
May God bless Mirza Ghalib, who has rightly said
“We are prepared to live in Delhi, how shall we subsist”?
What will be a better proof of affection and fidelity
With no love for you how intolerable will this cruelty be
Insistence is that in the ward committee I should also speak
But I shall speak after guessing if the Collector agreeable with me will be
Obtain the testimonial, it will be of use for sons
He is favorable now, later he may or may not be
Indians cannot find a place on the earth
But the oceans’ bottom available may be
Like the insensitive boat we are subservient to orders
We are bound to the bank or float as your desire may be
The Shaikh was giving a sermon on the mode of operation
“The infidels of India are very hard working in business
Polytheists are those having trade relations with polytheists
But our nation’s people are lacking in intelligence and sense
Unclean is the article touched by the infidel
Should listen if Muslim’s ears are amenable to truth!
A drunkard was also present in the sermon’s assembly
To whom such talks as those of the preacher were irksome
He said, “It is atrocious that in such restrictions
Are imprisoned the dealings in articles of eating and drink”
I said, “There is no difficulty for you
As in India Muslims also are liquor sellers!”
Let us see how long this business of the East lasts
People are buying cups and jars instead of din’s goblets
The cure of Love is the new education’s lancet
My surgeon is drawing blood from the Millat’s vein
The cow one day started saying to the camel
Nothing in the world rests in one condition
I am ignominious by breaking my rope
I hear you have also broken your nose string
Though you are important in India for political reasons
But due to railway the Arabian desert finds no use for you
Till yesterday you were avoiding the cow’s companionship
The voice of ‘never’ on your hanging lips was persistent
What is the matter that you are so favorable to me today
That old displeasure does not exist in your heart today
Hearing this speech the camel bashfully said
I am also to be counted among your lovers
The envy of hundreds of camel’s ogle is your one frisk
Since long I am the lover of such a frisk
The effects of your tumults have spread in the forest such
That speech has produced its taste even among the speechless
I am living only in one desert since a long time
As I have nothing I am fed on borrowed money
If goat, camel, cow, leopard and the lame donkey
All exist in the same condition we shall have prestige
If the gardener learns the lesson of uniformity
Why should not the gardens’ birds live in harmony
Give me also the same cup as only this appears proper
You should be intoxicated, your companions should also be intoxicated
“The patched garment of Hafiï is worthless, color him with wine
Then bring him to the market, lost and intoxicated
Last night the mosquito related to me
The whole story of his failures
“They give me only one drop of blood
In return for the whole night’s labor
And this land owner without any effort
Sucked all the blood of the cultivator”
This new `verse’ was revealed to me from the jail
That the Qur’an is in the Gata and the Gata is in the Qur’an
How well friendship developed between Shaikh and Brahman
In this battle after all neither this nor that was winning
“Badra” was already disgusted with the temple
“Masata” does not step out of the mosque, he is stubborn
Life may be lost but truth should not be lost
This one principle is the core of all religions
They are the birds of the same feather,
Banking, landlordship, monarchy
Capital and labor are in confrontation with each other
Let us see how many people’s expectations are destroyed
With cleverness and prudence this mischief cannot be delayed
Because “Wa qad kuntum biha tasta‘jilun”
Gog and Magog all have been released
The Muslim eye will see the meaning of Yansilun
That eternal rind has departed from the border of Sham
Shelving away all the rules and etiquette of the tavern
If so, how much is this the occasion for admonition
The blue sky changes its colors in a moment
Cursor certainly would be concerned with remedial measures
In the belly of obedience has started unequaled convulsion
Sir Agha Khan is demanding the delegation from India
Is this the digestive for devouring Iraq and Palestine
One day a dispute arose between the farmer and the owner
Each of them was saying that the land belonged to him
The farmer said that the field belonged to the cultivator
The owner said that the farmer had become demented
I asked the land as to whose property it was
It replied that it was believing only this:
Whether it be the owner or the wretched farmer
Whatever is under the sky is property of the land
Throw them out in the alley
The new civilization’s eggs are rotten
Election, membership, council, presidency
The nooses of independence are very strange
The carpenter has also been pared
The Europe’s planes are very sharp
The owner of the factory is a useless man
He is very pleasure loving, hard work does not suit him
God’s command is “Laisa lil Insani Illa Ma Sa‘a”
Fruit of laborer’s work should not be usurped by the capitalist
I have heard this was the talk in the factory yesterday
“The artisans only in old huts have their abode
But what a good council hall the government has made
In this city the capitalists did not have any abode”
Though the mosque was built overnight by the believers
Our heart being old sinner for years devout could not be
What a beautiful message did Sanusa give to King Faisal
By descent you Hijaza are, but in heart Hijaza could no be
Though eyes become wet there is no pleasure is in this weeping
If by mixture of affliction’s blood tears pink could not be
Iqbal is a good advisor, fascinates the heart in moments
He did become hero in talk, but one in deeds he could not be
A blaze is raging near His Throne , By my strains that burn like flames
The cries of "Mercy !" rise aloft , From the Temple of His Names .
Houris and angels, all alike, My soaring thought can keep in hold:
The moulds in which Thou dost reveal, Get ruffled by my glances bold.
In my search and quest for Thee, Cloisters and Kirks$9 I did design,
But my groans and woeful wails, Can shake the founds of Fane and Shrine .
There were times when my vision sharp, Pierced the heart and core of Life:
Time again, fell short of mark , By mine inner doubts and strife.
I was the only secret veil’d, In Nature’s Womb in Latent form:
When I was brought to light for show, What wondrous act Thou didst perform!
If the stars have strayed— To whom do the heavens belong, You or Me?
Why must I worry about the world— To whom does this world belong, You or Me?
If the Placeless Realm Offers no lively scenes of passion and longing,
Whose fault is that, my Lord?— Does that realm belong to You or to me?
On the morning of eternity he dared to say ʹNoʹ,
But how would I know why— Is he Your confidant, or is he mine?
Muhammad is Yours, Gabriel is Yours, The Qurʹan is Yours—
But this discourse, This exposition in melodious tunes, Is it Yours or is it mine?
Your world is illuminated, By the radiance of the same star
Whose loss was the fall of Adam, that creature of earth, Was it Yours or mine?
All potent wine is emptied of Thy cask;
Art Thou, indeed, a Cup‐bearer, may I ask?
Thou gavest me a drop from an ocean;
Art Thou a miser in a Nourisherʹs mask?
Bright are Your tresses: brighten them even more:
Ravish the senses and the mind, ravish the heart and the eyes.
Love concealed, and beauty too!
Reveal Yourself to me, or reveal me to myself.
You are the limitless ocean and I am but a tiny rivulet—
Either make Your peer or turn me limitless at least.
If I am a mother‐of‐pearl, the lustre of my pearl is in Your hands,
But if I am a piece of brick, give me a diamond’s sheen.
If I am not destined to sing at the advent of Spring,
Make this half‐enraptured breath a skylark of the Spring.
Why did You order me to quit the Garden of Eden?—
Now there is much to be done here—so just wait for me!
When the roll of my deeds is brought up on the Day of Reckoning,
Be ashamed as You will shame me.
Whether or not it moves you, At least listen to my complaint—
It is not redress this free spirit seeks.
This handful of dust, This fiercely blowing wind, And these vast, limitless heavens—
Is the delight You take in creation, A blessing or some wanton joke?
The tent of the rose could not withstand, The wind blowing through the garden:
Is this the spring season, And this the auspicious wind?
I am at fault, and in a foreign land,
But the angels never could make habitable, That wasteland of yours.
That stark wilderness, That insubstantial world of Yours
Gratefully remembers my love of hardship.
An adventurous spirit is ill at ease
In a garden where no hunter lies in ambush.
The station of love is beyond the reach of Your angels,
Only those of dauntless courage are up to it.
What avails love when life is so ephemeral?
What avaiIs a mortal’s love for the immortal?
Love that is snuffed out by death’s passing blast
Love without the pain, the passion that consumes?
A flickering spark I am, aglow for a fleeting glance
Flow vain for a flickering spark to chase an eternal flame!
Grant me the bliss of eternal life, O Lord,
And mine will be the ecstasy of eternal love.
Give me the pleasure of an everlasting pain
An agony that lacerates my soul for ever.
Make our hearts the seats of mercy and love,
And make them in Thy thought for ever move;
Give the invincible power of Ali the brave,
To one whom gavest Thou poor means to live.
If my scattered dust turns into a heart again,
It may pulsate again with the passions of the past.
If the nymphs of paradise entice me to sing,
The Fire within my heart will again warm their spirits.
Love has made me an ocean, boundless, fathomless,
But my self—awareness may change me into a shore.
In the world beyond, I fear lest my quest
May turn into a futile chase, a chase without an end.
Man’s rise has awakened jealous fear in the angels,
Lest this eclipsed star should one day become a full moon.

Contrary runs our planet, the stars whirl fast, oh Saki!
In every atom’s heartbeat a Doomsday blast, oh Saki!
Torn from God’s congregation its dower of faith and reason,
And godlessness in fatal allurement dressed, oh Saki!
For our inveterate sickness, our wavering heart, the cure—
That same joy‐dropping nectar as in the past, oh Saki.
Within Islam’s cold temple no fire of longing stirs,
For still your face is hidden, veiled and unguessed, oh Saki.
Unchanged is Persia’s garden: soil, stream, Tabriz, unchanged;
And yet with no new Rumi is her land graced, oh Saki.
But of his barren acres Iqbal will not despair:
A little rain, and harvests shall wave at last, oh Saki!
On me, a beggar, secrets of empire are bestowed;
My songs are worth the treasures Parvez amassed, oh Saki.
Set out once more that cup, that wine, oh Saki—
Let my true place at last be mine, oh Saki!
Three centuries India’s wine‐shops have been closed,
And now for your largesse we pine, oh Saki;
My flask of poetry held the last few drops—
Unlawful, says our crabb’d devine, oh Saki.
Truth’s forest hides no lion‐hearts now: men grovel
Before the priest, or the saint’s shrine, oh Saki.
Who has borne off Love’s valiant sword?
About An empty scabbard Wisdom’s hands twine, oh Saki.
Verse lights up life, while heart burns bright, but fades
For ever when those rays decline, oh Saki;
Bereave not of its moon my night; I see
A full moon in your goblet shine, oh Saki!
My Saki made me drink the wine, Of There is no god but He:
From the illusive world of sense, This cup divine has set me free.
Now I find no charm or grace, In song and ale, or harp and lute:
To me appeal the tulips wild, The riverside and mountains mute.
My flagon small is blessing great, For the age athirst and dry:
In the cells where mystics swell, Big empty gourds are lying by.
In love a novice I am yet, Much good for you to keep apart,
For my glance is restive more, Than my wild and untam’d heart.
The dark unfathomed caves of sea, Hold gems of purest ray serene:
The gems retain in midst of brine, Their essence bright and clean.
Through the poet’s quickening gaze, The rose and tulip lovelier seem:
No doubt, the minstrel’s piercing glance, Is nothing less than magic gleam.

Consuming fire for thee, O Lord, Is a gift I will not barter;
I will not change my vassal’s rank; With that of a master of men.
Neither this world nor the next; Is fit for the freedom—loving;
They are forced to die in this, And forced to live in the other.
Thy tantalizing reticence, Inflames my passion more;
Concealment is an elixir, For those who are lost in love.
The austere eagle lives in peace, On hills and in wilderneeses,
It never doth demean its pride, By building an abode for itself.
Who taught to young Isma’il, The ways of filial obedience?
Was it the blessing of a glance, Or the miracle of tutelage?
My grave is like a shrine, For men of thought and courage,.
For I have revealed truths sublime, To mere specks of dust.
The beauty of meaning need riot be, Adorned by my craft,
For nature does herself, Incarnadine the rose.
Have You forgotten then my heart of old,
That college of Love, that whip that bright eyes hold?
The school‐bred demi‐goddesses of this age
Lack the carved grace of the old pagan mold!
This is a strange world, neither cage nor nest,
With no calm nook in all its spacious fold.
The vine awaits Your bounteous rain: no more
Is the Magian wine in Persia’s taverns sold.
My comrades thought my song were of Spring’s kindling—
How should they know what in Love’s notes is told?
Out of my flesh and blood You made this earth;
Its quenchless fever the martyr’s crown of gold.
My days supported by Your alms, I do not
Complain against my friends, or the times scold.
By dint of Spring the poppy‐cup, With vintage red is over‐flown:
With her advent the hermit too, Temperance to the wind hath thrown.
When great and mighty force of Love, At some place its flag doth raise,
Beggars dressed in rags and sack, Become heirs true to King Parvez.
Antique the stars and old the dome, In which they roam about and move:
I long for new and virgin soil, Where my mettle I may prove.
The stir and roar of Judgement Day, Hath no dread for me at all:
Thine roving glance doth work on me, Like the Last Day’s Trumpet Call.
Snatch not from me the blessing great, Of sighs heaved at early morn:
With a casual loving look, Weaken not thine fierce scorn.
My sad and broken heart disdains, The Spring and dower that she brings:
Too joyous the song of nightingale! I feel more gloomy when it sings.
Unwise are those who tell and preach, Accord with times and the age.
If the world befits you not, A war against it you must wage.
Mine ill luck the same and same, O Lord, the coldness on Your part:
No useful aim has been served, By skill in poetic art.
Where am I and where are You, Is the world a fact or naught?
Does this world to me belong, Or is a wonder by You wrought?
The precious moments of my life, One by one have been snatched:
But still the conflict racks my brain, If heart and head are ever matched.
A hawk forgetful of its breed, Upbrought and fed in midst of kites,
Knows not the wont and ways of hawks, And cannot soar to mighty heights.
For song no tongue is set apart, No claim to tongues is laid by me:
What matters is a dainty song, No matter what its language be.
Faqr and Kingship are akin, Though at odds may these appear:
One wins the heart with single glance, The other rules with sword and spear.
Some have left the caravan train, And some on Ka‘bah turn their back;
For leaders of the Faithful Band, Winsome mode and manners lack.
Methought my racing field lay under the skies,
This plaything of water and clay, I regarded as my world;
Thy unveiling broke the spell of searching glances,
I mistook this blue vault for Heaven.
The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, methought, would keep me company,
Fatigued, they dropped out in the twists and turns of space:
One leap by Love ended all the pother,
I fondly imagined, the earth and sky were boundless.
What I esteemed as the clarion call of the caravan,
Was but the plaintive cry of a traveller, weary and forlorn.

Reason is either luminous, or it seeks proofs;
Proof—seeking reason is but an excess of wonder.
Thine alone is what I possess in this handful of dust;
And to keep it safe is beyond my power, O Lord.
My songs of lament were all inspired by Thee;
If they have reached the stars, it is no fault of mine.
Art Thou pleased, O Lord, with man’s imperfection?
Why repeat a flawed attempt, and make his shame eternal?
The Western ways have tried to make me a renegade;
But why are our mullahs a disgrace to Muslims?
Fools think man is a bondman of destiny;
But man has still the power to break the bonds of fate.
Thou hast Thy pantheon, and I have mine,
O Lord, Both have idols of dust; both have idols that die.
Lovely, oh Lord, this fleeting world; but why
Must the frank heart, the quick brain, droop and sigh?
Though usury mingle somewhat with his godship,
The white man is the world’s arch‐deity;
His asses graze in fields of rose and poppy:
One wisp of hay to genius You deny;
His Church abounds with roasts and ruby wines:
Sermons and saws are all Your mosques supply.
Your laws are just, but their expositors
Bedevil the Koran, twist it awry;
Your paradise no‐one has seen: in Europe
No village but with paradise can view.
Long, long have my thoughts wandered about heaven;
Now in the moon’s blind caverns let them sty!
I, dowered by Nature with empyreal essence,
Am dust—but not through dust does my way lie;
Nor East, nor west my home, nor Samarkand,
Nor Ispahan nor Delhi; in ecstasy,
God‐filled, I roam, speaking what truth I see—
No fool for priests, nor yet of this age’s fry.
My folk berate me, the stranger does not love me:
Hemlock for sherbet I could never cry;
How could a weigher of truth see Mount Damawand
And think a common refuse‐heap as high?
In Nimrod’s fire faith’s silent witness, not
Like mustard‐seed in the grate, burned splutteringly—
Blood warm, gaze keen, right‐following, wrong‐forswearing,
In fetters free, prosperous in penury,
In fair of foul untamed and light of heart—
Who can steal laughter from a flower’s bright eye?
Will no one hush this too proud thing Iqbal
Whose tongue God’s presence‐chamber could not tie!
All Nature’s vastness cannot contain you, oh
My madness: vain, those wanderings to and fro
In deserts! By selfhood only are the spells
Of sense broken,— that power we did not know.
Rub your eyes, sluggard! Light is Nature’s law,
And not unknown to Ocean its waves flow.
Where reason and revelation war, faith errs
To think the Mystic on his cross its foe,
For God’s pure souls, in thralldom or on thrones,
Have one safe shield, his scorn of this world’s show.
But do not, Gabriel, envy my rapture: better
For Heaven’s dounce folk the prayer and the beads’ neat row!
I have seen many a wine‐shop East and West;
But here no Saki, there in the grape no glow.
In Iran no more, in Tartary no more,
Those world‐renouncers who could overthrow
Great kings; the Prophet’s heir filches and sells
The blankets of the Prophet’s kin. When to
The Lord I was denounced for crying Doomsday
Too soon, by that Archangel who must blow
Its trumpet, God made answer—Is Doomsday far
When Makkah sleeps while China worships?— Though
The bowl of faith finds none to pour, the beaker
Of modern thought brims with the wine of No.
Subdued by the dexterous fiddler’s chords there murmurs
In the lowest string the wail of Europe’s woe—
Her waters that have bred the shark now breed
The storm‐wave that will smash its den below!
Slavery—exile from the love of beauty:
Beauty—whatever free men reckon so;
Trust no slave’s eyes, clear sight and liberty
Go hand in hand. His own resolves bestow
The empire of To‐day on him who fishes
To‐morrow’s pearl up from Time’s undertow.
The Frankish glassblowers’ arts can make stone run:
My alchemy makes glass flint‐hard. Pharaoh
Plotted and plots against me; but what harm?
Heaven lifts my hand, like Moses’, white as snow;
Earth’s rubbish‐heaps can never quell this spark
God struck to light whole deserts, His flambeau!
Love, self‐beholding, self‐sustaining, stands
Un‐awed at the gates of Caesar or Khosro;
If moon or Pleiades fall my prey, what wonder—
Myself bound fast to the Prophet’s saddle‐bow!
He—Guide, Last Envoy, Lord of All—lent brightness
Of Sinai to our dust; Love’s eyes, not slow
To kindle, hail him Alpha and Omega,
Chapter, and Word, and Book. I would not go
Pearl‐diving there, for reverence of Sina‘i;
But in these tides a million pearls still grow.
Who is this composer of ghazals, who is burningly passionate and cheerful?
He makes the thoughts of the wise full of madness.
Although poverty also has royal characteristics,
Kingship is only half complete without a kingdom.
Now in the cell of the Sufi, the same poverty has not remained—
The poverty whose charter is written in the blood of the hearts of lions.
Ah circle of dervishes, see how the man of God is,
In whose collar is the tumult of Judgement’s Day—
—who is as bright as a flame by the heat of repetition of God’s name;
Who is quicker than the lightning by the swiftness of his thought.
Kingship gives rise to signs of madness—
They are the scalpels of Allah, be they Taimur of Genghis.
Thus Iraq and Persia give me praise for my verse:
This Indian infidels sheds blood without swords or spears.
The secret divine my ecstasy has taught
I may convey if I have Gabriel’s breath.
What can these stars tell me of my fate?
They are lost themselves in the boundless firmament.
The total absorption of thought and vision is life,
Scattered thought is selfhood’s total death.
Pleasures of selfhood are a blessing of God,
Who makes me lose my awareness of myself.
With a pure heart, a noble aim, a poignant soul.
I care not for Solomon’s wealth or Plato’s thought.
The Prophet’s ‘Mairaj’ has taught me that heaven
Lies within the bounds of human reach.
This universe, perhaps, is yet incomplete,
For I hear repeated sounds of "Be, And It Was."
Thy mind is ruled by the magic of the West,
Thy cure lies in the Fire of Rumi’s faith.
It is he who has given my eyes a blissful vision,
It is he who has blessed my soul with light.
O myriad — coloured earth! Which of us is a secret revealed’?
And which of us is the world, The Invisible One loves more?
Which of us is the call to prayer, Or the silvery dawn,
Of that night of pain and sorrow, That goes by the name of life?
Which of us is affirmed, By the revolving day and night?
And which of us is a burden, On this vast universe?
Thou art dust and blind, I am dust and self—aware;
Which of us is the crown and glory, Ruling all life?
Thou art yet region—bound, Transcend the limits of space;
Transcend the narrow climes, Of the East and the West.
For selfless deeds of men, Rewards are less mundane;
Transcend the houris glances, The pure, celestial wine.
Ravishing in its power, Is beauty in the West;
Thou bird of paradise, Resist this earthly trap.
With a mountain—cleaving assault, Bridging the East and West,
Despise all defences, And become a sheathless sword.
Thy imam is unabsorbed, Thy prayer is uninspired,
Forsake an imam like him, Forsake a prayer like this.
The free by dint of faqr, Life’s secrets can disclose:
With Gabriel faqr is bound, By ties of kinship close.
The scholar, mystic and The bard, by thinking wrong,
Many a bark have sunk, That was sound and strong.
You need a burning glance, That cows down lions bold:
Only the sheep and goats, Heave sighs deep and cold.
Love’s physician scanned my face, And thus he did bespeak,
“You have no ailment, but Your zeal is faint and weak.”
The soul that knows no stain, Is something quite discreet:
The glow and tint of blood, Is wrought by bread and meat.
Hill and vale once more under the poppy’s lamps are bright,
In my heart the nightingale has set new songs alight;
Violet, violet, azure, azure, golden, golden, mantles—
Flowers, or fairies of the desert, rank on rank in sight?
On the rosy‐spray dawn’s soft breeze has left a pearl of dew,
Now the sunbeam turns this gem a yet more glittering white.
Town or woodland, which is sweeter, if for her unveiling
Careless beauty love towns less than where green woods invite?
Delve into your soul and there seek our life’s buried tracks;
Will you not be mine? then be not mine, be your own right!
World of soul—the world of fire and ecstasy and longing:
World of sense—the world of gain that fraud and cunning blight;
Treasure of the soul once won is never lost again:
Treasure gold, a shadow—wealth soon comes and soon takes flight.
In the spirit’s world I have not seen a white man’s Raj,
In that world I have not seen Hindu and Muslim fight.
Shame and shame that hermit’s saying pouted on me—you forfeit
Body and soul alike if once you cringe to another’s might!
Muslims are born with a gift to charm, to persuade;
Brave men—they are endowed with a noble courtesy.
Slaves of custom are all the schools of old;
They teach the eaglet to grovel in the dust.
These victims of the past have seen the dawn of hope,
When I revealed to them the eagle’s ways.
The man of God knows but two words of faith;
The scholar has tomes of knowledge old and new.
About wine and women I know not how to write;
Ask not a stone-breaker to work on glass.
O Iqbal! From where did you learn to be such a dervish:
Even among the kings there is talk about your contentment!
Through Love the song of Life, Begets its rhythmic flow:
From Love the shapes of clay, Derive an endless glow.
Love makes its way to all, The pores in human flesh,
Like dewy wind of morn, That makes the rose twig fresh.
If man denies his God, On kings he has to fawn:
By trust in God, the kings, To his door are drawn.
Free heart lends kingly state, To belly death is due:
Decide which of the two, Is better in your view.
O Muslim, search your heart, Of mullah don’t ask it,
“The sacred House of God, The righteous why have quit?”
Of passion’s glow your heart is blank, Your glances are not chaste and frank:
To wonder at then there is naught, That bold and dauntless you are not.
A longing strong for God’s display, Is also hid in self‐same clay:
O heedless man, let this be known, Brains alone you do not own.
The eye whose light and luster rest, On collyrium brought from West:
Is full of art, conceit and show, It gets not wet at others’ woe.
How can the priest and monk assess, The height of craze that I possess?
still sound the hems of robes they wear, Which have no rifts and know no tear.
How long the stars shall hold their sway, On fate of man, sprung from clay?
Either bereft of life I drop, Or the Wheel of Fate must stop.
Lightning I am and keep my eye, On waste and hill that reach the sky:
Heaps of straw and mounds of dust, Too low they are, avoid I must.
That godly man gets world’s bequest, Who risks his life in ceaseless quest:
That man no Faith can claim at all, Who lives not up to Prophet’s call.
A host of peril though you face, Yet your tongue with heart ally:
From times antique and hoar, Qalandars on this mode rely.
Men congregate in numbers large, In the mart where wine is sold,
For polite and courteous seems, The Head of Mart, the Magian Old.
Though the points by Razi touched, May be subtle and profound,
Yet against infirm belief, No cure in them is ever found.
The disciple blind shed copious tears, Of sinful life he felt contrite.
May God aid the shaykh as well, To feel ashamed and do the right!
Man is bound still hand and foot, In chains by this talisman old,
For idols of the age of past, Still men within their armpits hold.
Enough for me that I affirm, With tongue alone my faith and creed:
A thousand thanks for mullah’s claim, That he with heart avows, indeed.
As good as Muslim’s true belief, If blessed with Love, unfaith is eke:
Bereft of Love a Muslim true, Is no better than Zindiq.
Rely on the witness of the phenomenal world
To know whether you are on the mark or have gone astray:
Neither kingship nor poverty for a Muslim who lacks in faith,
The one who has it is a king even if he be poor.
He depends on the sword if he lacks in faith:
If he has faith he may need no weapons in the fight.
A Muslim without faith yields to what his fate ordains;
With faith, he is destiny incarnate.
I revealed the secrets and rent the veil,
But your blindness has no cure.
These Western nymphs, A challenge to the eye and the heart,
Are bold of glance, In a paradise of instant bliss.
Thy heart is a wavering ship, Tossed by beauty’s assault
These moons and stars that glisten, Are whirlpools in thy sea.
The warblings of the harp and lyre, Have wondrous powers
Powers that cannot be captured, In the world of sound.
By teaching him the monastic wont and way,
The Sufi has led astray the jurist of the town.
The prostration that once, Shook the earth’s soul,
Now leaves not a trace, On the mosque’s decadent walls.
I have not heard in the Arab world, The thunderous call
The call to prayer that pierced, The hearts of hills in the past.
O Qartaba! Perhaps, Some magic in thy air
Has breathed into my song, The buoyancy of youth.
A heart awake to man imparts, Umar’s brains and Hyder’s manly parts:
If watchful heart a man may hold, His dross is changed to sterling gold.
Beget a heart alive and sound, For, if it be in slumber bound,
You cannot strike a deadly blow, Nor even I can daring show.
If sense of smell be full and stunted, The musk‐deer never can be hunted:
If bereft of sense of smelling true, Surmise and guess can yield no clue.
My sighs no more I can withhold, When Muslims’ sloth I do behold:
If Muslims do not mend their way, Magians their luck might steal away.
These simple thralls of Yours, O Lord, From every house and door are barred:
For kings, no less the acolytes, Are fraudulent and hypocrites.
The freedom that this age does grant, Does ever freedom’s essence want:
Though freedom seems to outward sight, Yet is no less than prison tight.
O Lord of Yathrib! Cure provide, For doubts that in my breast abide:
My wisdom to the West is due, Girdled my faith like Brahman true.
In the coquetry and fierceness of the self there, is no pride, there are no airs.
Even if there are airs, then they are not without the pleasure of submission.
The eye of love is in search of the living heart;
hunting for carrion does not befit up to the royal hawk.
In my song there is no charming and romantic grace,
For the blast of the trumpet of Israfil is not meant to please the heart.
I will not ask for wine from the Frank, Saki,
for this is not the way of the pure‐hearted profligates.
The rule of love has never been widespread in the world.
The reason is this—that love is no time‐server.
One continual anxiety—whether absent or present!
If I tell it myself, my story is not long.
If you desire then read the Persian Psalms in seclusion;
The midnight lament is not bereft of secrets.
A recreant captain, a battle‐line thrown back,
The arrow hanging target‐less and slack!
Nowhere near you that shell which holds life’s pearl;
I have dragged the waves and searched the ocean’s track.
Plunge in your self, on idols dote no more,
Pour our no more heart’s blood for paint to deck
Their shrines. I unveil the courts of Love and Death:
Death—life dishonoured; Love—death for honour’s sake.
I gleaned in Rumi’s company: one bold heart
Is worth of learned heads the whole tame pack;
Once more that voice from Sinai’s tree would cry
Fear not! if some new Moses led the attack.
No glitter of Western science could dazzle my eyes
The dust of Medina stains, like collyrium, black.
At London, winter wind, like sword, was biting though,
My wont to rise at early morn I didn’t forego.
At times my heated talk to gathering pleasure lent;
My holding ’loof at times perplexed them all, I trow.
No hope for change is there, if workers rule the land,
For those who hew the rocks, like Parvez tricks do know.
Statecraft divorced from Faith to reign of terror leads,
Though it be a monarch’s rule or Commoners’ Show.
The streets of Rome remind of Delhi’s glorious past,
The lesson same and charm are writ upon its brow.
The ancient fane in which we live, Has heaps of thorns at every turn;
Too hard to cross it safe and sound, Without the aid of sighs that burn.
The tale of quarry shot by Love, Is simple, brief and not too long:
The victim feels the joy of prick, And then the rest of saddle thong.
The sterling truth to Muslim taught, In feuds of different sects is lost;
How can you catch this truth again, With bias if your mind be fraught?
One is the outward form of faith, The other its spirit deep and true:
He, who quaffs its spirits deep, Brings secrets hidden to his view.
O pilgrim wise, who tread the path, If passion strong for faith you lack,
The bough of faith shall whither fast, Obscure and dim become the path.
Courage and valour are the signs, By which the state of Love is known:
Not every zeal is pert and rude, Nor daring by ev’ry person shown.
On the Day of Judgement too, My frenzy will not let me rest:
With Mighty God I shall contend, Or rend to fragments my own vest.
The way to renounce is, To conquer the earth and heaven;
The way to renounce is not, To starve oneself to death.
O cultists! I like not, Your austere piety;
Your piety is penury, Suffering and grief.
A nation that has lost, Taimur’s great heritage,
Is unfit for piety, And is unfit to rule.
If the sweet Cup—bearer, Listens not to me, it is good;
When I say, ‘no more’, That will only bring me more.
The Sufi and his peers, Are all engrossed in a glimpse;
They know not that concealment, Is itself a vision.
Bondage is freedom, With favours from on high,
And when favours are withheld, Even freedom is bondage.
The West is a treasure-house, For the reason’s quest;
But for the heart it is, A source of decay and death.
Though reason to the portal guide,
Yet entry to it is denied.
Beg God to grant a lighted heart,
For light and sight are things apart.
Though knowledge lends to mind a glow,
No houris its Eden can ever show.
How strange that in the present time
No one owns the joy sublime!
Some passions leave the mind intact,
While others make it blind to fact.
The heart from unrest gets its life,
What pity if it knows no strife!
You die because from God you flee,
If living, linked with God shall be.
The pearls have all their covering cleft,
Of urge to show you are bereft.
Show unto me, though I too cry,
It is not tale of Moses and Sinai.
The self of man is ocean vast, And knows no depth or bound:
If you take it for a stream, How can your mind be sound?
The magic of this whirling dome, We can set at naught:
Not of stone but of glass, Its building has been wrought.
In Holy Trance in self we drown, And up we rise again;
But how a worthless man can show, So much might and main?
Your rank and state cannot be told, By one who reads the stars:
You are living dust, in sooth, Not ruled by Moon or Mars.
The maids of Ed’n and Gabriel eke, In this world can be found,
But, alas! You lack as yet, Glances bold and zeal profound.
My craze has judged aright the bent, Of times wherein I am born:
Love be thanked for granting me, The gown entire and untorn.
Spite of Nature’s bounty great, Its guarding practice, mark!
It grants the ruby reddish hue, But denies the heat of spark.
The morning breeze has whispered to me a secret,
That those who know their Selfhood, are equal to kings.
Selfhood is the essence of thy life and honour,
Thou shalt rule with it, but without it be in disgrace.
Thou hast not led my way, O man of wisdom!
But why, complain? Thou knowest not the way.
Fakirs who know the wont and way of kings
Are as yet being trained in my literary circle.
Thy monastic cult is a strait and narrow path,
Which I like not, but thy freedom I respect.
This world of inferior prey is meant to sharpen thy claws,
Thou art an eagle—hunter, but art a novice yet.
Whether thou art in the East or West, thy faith
Is meaningless, unless thy heart affirms it.
Thy vision and thy hands are chained, earthbound,
Is it thy nature’s fault, or of the thought too high?
The schoolmen have strangled thy nascent soul,
And stifled the voice of passionate faith in thee.
Absorb thyself in selfhood, seek the path of God,
This is the only way for thee to find freedom.
Ask an unclad dervish what the heart doth say,
May God show thee thy place in the world of men.
If bare‐headed, have a towering will,
The crown is not for thee, but for the eagle alone.
When thou losest selfhood, thou losest power, too;
Blame not the stars and fate for thy fall.
Monasteries and schools left me sad and dejected,
No life and no love; no vision and no knowledge.
The mind can give you naught, But what with doubt is fraught:
One look of Saintly Guide, Can needful cure provide.
The goal that you presume, Is far and out of view:
What else can be this life, But zeal for endless strife?
Much worth the pearl begets, For guard on self it sets:
What else in pearl is found, Except its sheen profound?
Though blood in veins may race, To Life it lends no grace:
Only the glow of heart, To Life can zeal impart.
Wherefore, O Tulip Bride, From me your charms you hide?
I am the breath of morn, Your face I would adorn.
What Frankish dealers take, For counterfeit and fake,
Is true and real art— Not valued in their Mart.
Though indigent I be, I am of hand yet free:
What can the Flame bestow, Except its spark and glow?
The splendour of a monarch great, Is worthless for the free and bold:
Where lies the grandeur of a king, Whose riches rest on borrowed gold?
You pin your faith on idols vain, And turn your back on Mighty God:
If this is not unbelief and sin, What else is unbelief and fraud?
Luck favours the fool and the mean, And exalts and lifts to the skies
Only those who are base and low, And know not how to patronize.
One look from the eyes of the Fair, Can make a conquest of the heart:
There is no charm in the fair sweet, If it lacks this alluring art.
I am a target for the hate, Of the mighty rich and the great,
As I know the end of Caesars great, And know the freaks of luck or fate.
To be a person great and strong, Is the end and aim of all;
But that rank is not real and true, That is attained by the ego’s fall.
My bold and simple mode of life, Has captured each and every heart;
Though my numbers are lame and dull, And lay no claim to poet’s art.
You are neither for the earth nor for the heaven:
The world is for you, and not you for the world.
The sparks Reason and Heart are shed of the flame of Love:
That one to burn the straw, this one for burning the field of reeds.
This garden is for painful strains:
Neither for enjoying the roses nor for making a nest.
How long, while your ship remains in Ravi, Nile and Euphrates?
When it is meant for the Ocean, which knows no bounds.
Once who were beacons to the brightest stars,
Have long been awaiting a guide to show them the way now.
High ambition, winsome speech, a passionate soul—
This is all the luggage for a leader of the Caravan.
It was a plain and simple truth but the imagination of the Persian mind
Has confounded it with the poetic license.
I am saving a song for the Placeless Realm—
A song that could shake even the trusty Gabriel.
O Prisoner of Space! You are not far from the Placeless Realm—
That Audience Hall is not far away from your planet.
Grieve not, for a meadow that faces no threat from the Autumn,
Is not far away from your nest.
The gist of all Gnostic knowledge is merely this:
That life is an arrow spent and yet from the bow it is not too far!
Your station lies a little ahead of all the stars and Pleiades:
Move on, for it is not a long way from the skies.
Lest he asks the guide to let him be!
It would be no surprise from a traveller who thinks too much.
My mind on me bestowed a thinker’s gaze,
From Love I learnt a toper’s wont and ways.
No wine, no flask, no goblet goes around,
Sweet looks to banquet lend its hue and sound.
Take not my rhymes for poet’s art,
I know the secrets of wine‐seller’s mart.
Behold the bud athirst for breath of Morn,
It tells the story of my heart forlorn.
Know not, absence or presence if it be,
I am the alien here, all others free.
My stay in West I may prolong a bit,
My frenzy if this desert will admit.
The stage of mind by Iqbal soon was crost,
But in the Vale of Love this sage was lost.
From the heavens comes an answer to our long cries at last:
The heavens break their silence, the curtains rise at last!
Little of change love’s fortunes inherit: born in anguish
And fire, in fire and anguish its end it buys at last.
The destiny of nations I chart for you: at first
The sword and spear; the zither’s, the lute’s soft sighs at last.
Outlandish are the customs that Europe’s tavern knows!
It steeps men first in pleasure, the wine supplies at last.
Be it the awe of Nadir, be it the glory of a Tamerlane:
At last all exploits are drowned in a barrel of wine.
The cloistered hour is over, the arena’s hour begins;
The lightning comes to asunder those cloudy skies at last!
It was too hard to withhold the flood of these truths,
At last the Qalandar revealed the secrets of the Book.
All life is voyaging, all life in motion,
Moon, stars, and creatures, of air and ocean.
To you the champion, the lord of battle,
Bright angels offer, their swords’ devotion
But of that blindness, that caravan spirit!
Of your own greatness, you have no notion.
How long this bondage to darkness? Choose now:
A prince’s scepter,— a hermit’s potion.
I know our priesthood, how faint in action,
In sermons pouring, a languid lotion.
Every atom pants for glory: greed
Of self‐fruition earth’s whole creed!
Life that thirsts for no flowering—death:
Self‐creation—a godlike deed;
Through self the mustard‐seed becomes
A hill: without, the hill a seed.
The stars wander and do not meet,
To all things severance is decreed;
Pale is the moon of night’s last hour
No whispered things of friendship speed.
Own self is all the light you need;

You are this world’s sole truth, all else,
Illusion such as sorceries breed.
These desert thorns prick many a doubt:
Do not complain if bare feet bleed.
This wonder by some glance is wrought, Or Fortune’s wheel has come full round:
At last the Frankish charm has broke, The East by which in past was bound.
By the building of my nest, This secret hid was brought to view
That for the bards that sing and chant, The choice of nest is bolt from blue.
If slave to God, you grow divine, If slave to world a beggar mean:
You are the master of your fate, So make the choice the two between.
Of selfhood heedless never be, Your gaze to self always confine:
Who knows, you mat anon become, The threshold of some sacred shrine.
O heir to creed no god but He, In you I see no sign or trace
Of mighty deeds that terror strike, Your talk devoid of charm and grace.
Your glances bold would strike the heart, With awe, though sheathed within the breast:
Alas! a qalandar’s fervent zeal, In you is dead and is at rest.
Of Sanctuary’s secret hid, Iqbal perhaps is well aware:
His speech and song display alike, A confidential mode and air.
Why should I ask wise men about my origin?
For my mind ponders on the end of my life.
Raise thy Selfhood so high that before each dispensation,
God Himself may ask thee what thy wishes are.
If I am an alchemist, my only alchemy
Is the yearning and the passion that consume my heart.
I know not about those dark, unknown, mysterious eyes,
That, in their fathomless depths, have power over my fate.
If that absorbed man of the West had been alive today,
Iqbal would have taught him about the attributes of God.
The agony of morning sighs has lacerated my heart,
If this is a punishment, O God, what sin have I committed?
When through the Love man conscious grows, Of respect self‐awareness needs,
Though in chains, he learns at once, The regal mode and kingly deeds.
Like Rumi, Attar, Ghazzali and Razi, One may be mystic great or wise,
But none can reach his goal and aim, Without the help of morning sighs.
No need for leaders sage and great, To lose all hope of Muslim true:
Though amiss this pilgrim be, Yet can burn on fire like rue.
O Bird, that flies to the Throne of God, You must keep this truth in sight,
To suffer death is nobler far, Than bread that clogs your upward flight.
A person poor and destitute, Who walks in steps of God’s Lion bold,
Is more exalt’d than monarchs great: He spurns the worldly wealth and gold.
Men bold and firm uphold the truth, And let no fears assail their hearts:
No doubt, the mighty Lions of God, Know no tricks and know no arts.
Once more I feel the urge to wail, And weep at dead of night:
O traveller, stop a bit, perchance, I face some awful site.
Awhile in dark abyss of Fate, Dive and see beneath:
Out of this battlefield I come, Like sword out of the sheath.
This verse some man with witty mind, On niche of mosque did write:
These fools fell prostrate on the earth, When it was time to fight.”
O man, who at my misery scoff, Follow the road you tread:
When the cup to me was passed, The gathering all had fled.
Iqbal his glow to Muslims lent, Who in India dwell:
An easy‐going man he was, And served the sluggards well.
To find Iqbal for years on end, I did chafe and fret:
By effort great that kingly hawk, Has come within my net.
This onrush of yearning— I cannot live without it,
For the quintessence of my life, Is this onrush of yearning.
Nature doth impel me, To warble a song of the heart;
It strikes perhaps a chord, In some responsive hearts.
That Promethean Fire, Can always set thy soul ablaze.,
Blame not thy Maker, If thou lackest that fire.
Do not be glamourized, By the luminous flash of the West;
That flash is the blessing, Of incandescent lamps.
If thy eyes are not aflame, With a global vision,
Thy heart will not be stirred, By the passion to conquer the world.
A hunter’s prey I would not be, Even in winter’s wrath,
If my abode had not been, So meagre, so exposed.
It is not my fantasy, But a truth revealed:
Orders will be toppled, And fates will be topsy—turvy.
Nature before your mind present,
Subdue this world of hue and scent.
Of selfhood you appear bereft,
To find the thing lost go on quest.
The stars do shine in boundless space,
Desire to get this lofty place.
Disrobed the houris of your mead,
The rose and tulip darning need.
Of urge, though Nature not deplete,
Yet where it fails you must complete.
Alas! These men of church and mosque are known,
To do their best to make the soul benighted.
It is faith, and faith alone, that gives the power—
The power of the dervish, that conquers kings.
My soul’s yearning takes a thousand forms:
Wonder, and ecstasy, and plaints at dawn.
Heavenly love is beyond the pale of reason;
The pain of being estranged is the heart’s death.
His pride in Beauty makes Him show Himself,
But my eyes’ vision is the hindering veil.
The logic of destiny is beyond our ken;
As the losing Turks were no worse than the Ottomans.
How was Iqbal captured by the Holy Land fakirs?
This ethereal eagle has escaped even kings.
Reason has devised again the magic of ancient days;
What the magic needs, is a new Moses’ wand.
The intellect, in its cunning. assumes a thousand shapes;
But love, a simpleton, is not a mullah, nor is wise.
Travellers on the path of love should deny themselves a goal;
We are all travellers, but seem to have a home.
Grieve not about thy equipment in travel,
Mountains and rivers can be crossed like a breeze.
The dervish’s asset is freedom on his death;
This silver and gold ‘nisab’ is not the law for him.
Other worlds exist beyond the stars—
More tests of love are still to come.
This vast space does not lack life—
Hundreds of other caravans are here.
Do not be content with the world of colour and Smell,
Other gardens there are, other nests, too.
What is the worry if one nest is lost?
There are other places to sigh and cry for!
You are an eagle, flight is your vocation:
You have other skies stretching out before you.
Do not let mere day and night ensnare you,
Other times and places belong to you.
Gone are the days when I was alone in company—
Many here are my confidants now.
The West seeks to make life a perpetual feast;
A wish in vain, in vain, in vain!
Aware of my state, my spiritual guide assures me,
Thy ecstasy has reached the plenitude of its power.
Moses asked for a Divine glimpse, but I do not:
The demand was right for him; but is forbidden for me.
The plaint of the men of God betrays a suppressed secret;
But the ways of the men of God are not meant for all.
Zikr in the Sufis’ circle was devoid of ecstasy,
I remained unsatisfied, and so was everyone.
Love is thy goal, and mine, too, but both
Are so far novices on the path of love.
Alas! Thou hast betrayed the secret of a fakir,
Though a fakir has wealth more than a king of men.
Selfhood is Gabriel’s power, If fortified by learning;
And Israfeel’s trumpet, If fortified by love.,
I am aware of the torture, Of the inferno of modern reason,
For I was hurled into its fire, Like Abraham the blessed.
The caravan is deluded: It seeks a place of rest,
Though the pleasure of a journey, Is greater than that of the goal.
I do remember now, Discourses in the West;
That was the veil of logic; This is the joy of Presence.
These secrets of Selfhood are, A sword burnished bright;
So join not my circle, Without a keener vision.
Thou art alone, abandoned, In the night’s darkness;
My flame—begotten song, Is for thee a beacon of light.
The Holy Land’s story, Is colourful, simple, strange;
It begins with Isma’il, And ends with Hussain.
Does freshness of thought, Exist in any school?
And do the sanctums provide, Pleasures esoteric?
Thy goal is far away, The journey a Herculean task;
Is there a leader of men, Who could guide this caravan?
This war for faith is greater, Than the Khayber war;
Is there in our age, A warrior as brave as Ali?
Beyond the realm of knowledge, Are pleasures for the Muslim—
he pleasures of ecstasy, The pleasures of a vision.
Discerning eyes can see, In the luminous dome of the West,
Cracks and rifts at the base, Shattering glass at the top.
Events as yet folded in the scroll of Time
Reflect in the mirror of my perception.
Neither the planets, nor the spinning skies—
Only my bold song—can tell you your destiny.
Either my sighs are devoid of fire,
Or else your straw and thorns as yet retain some sap;
Yet perchance my morning song
May quicken the fire that your dust contains—
The dust that will break the spell of the passing time one day,
Though it is entangled in the skein of Fate as yet.
Sufis lack the fire, the passion that consumes,
But in miracles and in wonders their circles abound.
Be it the king’s palace, or the fakir’s sanctum,
Both have. usurped God’s power of providing sustenance.
On the Day of Judgement, God will be embarrassed
By the blank book of the Sufi, and the mindless mullah.
The world— wanderer does not yield to the world’s shackles,
Be it Arabia the blessed, The ‘Immortal City’ or China.
Inebriation of the night is a vaporous memory now,
But The Cup—bearer’s glances are an eternal flame.
Bear with my songs, venom — bared and harsh—
For it is venom that acts as an antidote sometimes.
A song that has the power of thunderbolts from heaven,.
Is worthier than all the wealth of kings and potentates.
Intuition in the West was clever in its power,
But had not the plenitude for absolute abandon.
The quintessence of life is the force of faith supreme—
It is a force denied to all our seats of learning.
The galaxies, the planets, the firmament, are all
Waiting for man’s rise, like a star in heaven.
Brains are bright and hearts are dark and eyes are bold,
Is this the sum and substance of what our age has gained?
The world is a haystack for the fire of the Muslim soul,
But if thou art eyeless, thou canst not find thy way.
To a multitude of men, reason is the guide,
They know not that frenzy has a wisdom of its own.
The world entire is a legacy of the Man of Faith:
I say it on the authority of We would not have created it.
Cut the Gordian knot, And capture thy jewel;
Be of courage, be united, Have a spirit free.
The ascetic fakir, Clad only in rags,
Is mightier in power, Than kings that rule the earth.
Farabi had a mind; Rumi had a soul;
One ended in astonishment, The other in absorption.
Choose the cunning of reason, Or love and the help of God;
Either the guile of the West, Or the valour of the Turk—,
Either a Muslim’s path, Or servitude to the idols;
And a cry of passionate faith, In Kaaba or the temple.
Whether a king or a fakir, A master or a slave,
What thou needst most, Is courage with abandon.
Neither the power of kings, Nor the might of armies,
Has the force of the pious, Indifferent to both the worlds.
‘There is no God but God’, Is the essence of the secret.,
The world is a temple, And the man of God is Abraham.
Thy world is the world, Thou dost create thyself.,
And not the world of brick and mortar, Before thy outward eyes.
Thy dust that should aspire, Beyond the moon and stars,
Is languishing still on its way, Fettered and earth—bound.
The West is faced with a torrent— Gigantic, monster—like,
A torrent that will engulf, Its power over the world.
My sighs by day and night, Open a world anew,
Seek this world of mine, In the ethereal region.
Though I have the remains, Of a potent wine left,
Better it is than the emptiness, Of monasteries and schools.
On me no subtle brain though Nature spent,
My dust hides strength to dare the high ascent—
That frantic dust whose eye outranges reason,
Dust by whose madness Gabriel’s rose is rent;
That will not creep about its garden gathering
Straw for a nest—un‐housed and yet content.
And Allah to this dust a gift of tears
Whose brightness shames the constellations, lent.
By men whose eyes see far and wide new cities shall be founded:
Not by old Kufa or Baghdad is my thought’s vision bounded.
Rash youth, new‐fangled learning, giddy pleasure, gaudy plume,—
With these, while these still swarm, the Frankish wine‐shop is surrounded.
Not with philosopher, nor with priest, my business; one lays waste
The heart, and one sows discord to keep mind and soul confounded;
And for the Pharisee—far from this poor worm be disrespect!
But how to enfranchise Man, is all the problem I have sounded.
The fleshpots of the wealthy are for sale about the world;
Who bears love’s toils and pangs earns wealth that God’s hand has compounded.
I have laid bare such mysteries as the hermit learns, that thought,
In cloister or in college, in true freedom may be grounded.
No fastings of Mahatmas will destroy the Brahmins’ sway;
Vainly, when Moses holds no rod, have all his words resounded!
To God the angels did complain ʹGainst Iqbal and did say
That rude and insolent is he, Nature he paints much gay.
Though born of mud and water, yet A god assumes to be:
Not bound to any home or land, Of earthly ties is free.
To throngs of Heaven he has taught, Like man, to fret and pine.
To clay‐made man he fain would teach, The wont and mode divine.
Over the tussle of heart and head
Rumi has won and Rizi fled.
Still bowl of Jamshid is alive,
Without guile kingship cannot thrive.
Both you and I aren’t Muslims true,
Though we say the prayers due.
I know the end of wrangle well
Where mullahs at each other yell.
Turkish and Arabic both are sweet,
For talk of Love all tongues are meet.
The breed of Azar idols make,
But Friends of God these idols break.
You are alive and live for aye
The rest is all a play with clay.
Arise! The bugle calls! It is time to leave!
Woe be to the traveller who still awaits!
The confines of a monastery suit thee not—
The times have changed, thou seest, and so hast thou.
Thorny is the path, O seeker of salvation!
Whether thy heart is the slave or the master of reason.
The Selfhood of one who bemoans all change,
Is yet a prisoner of time, shackled by days and nights.
O songbird! Thy song is well rewarded when
It infuses fire into the rose’s bloom.
The Gnostic and the common throng, New life have gained through my song:
I have conferred relish fine, On them for Loveʹs fiery wine.
Some Ajami near the Holy Shrine, Did sadly sing this song and pine,
“Alas! the robes by pilgrims worn, To threads and pieces now are torn.”
The place of Husain, the Martyr great, Is fact, not bound to Space or Date,
Though the Syrians and the Kufis may, Often change their wont and way.
The gamblers who with you compete, Are deft of band and they can cheat:
Your fumbling shaky hands, I fear, May bring about your ruin so drear.
No wonder If the Muslims gain, Their ancient glory once again–
Sanjarʹs splendour pomp and state, The piety and faqr of mystics great.
The robe of art and lore I wear, Is through Your special bounty there:
You know my coarse and homely frame, To honour great I have no claim.
The crescent has surpassed, The constellation’s might
And grown in plenitude, With arduous labour.
In vain does a bud, Blossom in confined air,
If it., bloom has been, Denied the rays of the sun.
If thy eye is pure, So will be thy heart,
For the heart mirrors, all, That the eye ever sees.
The mountain flower grows not, In gardens well trimmed,
Despising,, to keep company, With meaner growths oil earth.
Who cares for the wars, Fought by mighty kings?
But the songs of mortal poets, Enjoy an immortal fame.
In the maze of eve and morn, O man awake, do not be lost:
Another world there yet exists, That has no future or the past.
None knows that tumult’s worth and price, Which hidden lies in future’s womb:
The mosque, the school and tavern too, Since long are silent like a tomb.
In tears shed at early morn, Is found the gem unique and best,
The gem, whose like is never held, By mother shell within its breast.
The Culture New is nothing else, Save glamour false and show, indeed:
If the face be fair and bright, Rouge vendors aid it does not need.
Much care and caution must he take, Who sets the music of a song:
For oft the Voice Unseen inspires, Such airs as jarring are and wrong.
The cloisters, once the rearing place, Of daring men and royal breed,
Alas! Now nothing else impart— To foxy ways they pay much heed.
The chiefs who lead the caravan train, Of that virtue quite are blank,
Which is found in shepherd’s task, And leads to Moses’ noble rank.
How can the birds with voices sweet, The thrilling joy of song attain?
Alas! The birds in hostile mead, Cannot their breath for long sustain.
One type of rapture and surprise, Is darkness deep and pitch complete;
The other rapture and surprise, With love and knowledge is replete.
My thoughts sublime that soar aloft, Like the flash of lightning, show the way;
Lest travellers in the dark of night, Should miss the track and go astray.
Salman the mellifluous, In words of power and wit,
Said the world is too narrow, For men of skill and daring.
But one should have a lion’s heart, An eagle’s piercing eye,
Then one can live without the light, Of a lexicon and learning.
Ape not the ways of the nightingale, Nor those of the peacock,
For the one is but a voice, And the other is but a colour.
The crown, the throne, and mighty arms, By faqr are wrought these wonders all:
In short, it is the chief of chiefs, And king of other kings withal.
By means of learning mind and brain, No doubt, become refined and pure:
Faqr makes the heart and gaze of man, From earthly filth and dross secure.
Scholar and sage knowledge makes, But Christ and Moses by faqr are wrought:
To faqr the road is fully known, Of road the scholar knows not aught.
The state of seeing faqr bestows, But knowledge makes on new rely:
Rapture in faqr is virtue great, Whereas in knowledge sin so high.
One God there is that knowledge owns, To other God faqr lays a claim:
No god but He, I do proclaim, No god but He, I do proclaim.
On the whetting stone of faqr, When sword of Self gets sharp and bright,
A single stroke by warrior bold, Can out an army big to flight.
Within your clay, if there exist, A heart alive and wide awake,
The glass of sun and moon as well, One look of yours forthwith can break.
In my craze that knows no bound, Of the Mosque I made the round:
Thank God that outer vest of Shrine, Still was left untorn and fine.
I wish good luck and pleasure great, To all, of faith who always prate
But all the jurists of the town, With one accord upon me frown.
Men, like Plato, still roam about, Betwixt belief and utter doubt
Men endowed with reason, aye, Ever on the heights do stay.
Unless the Bookʹs each verse and part, Be revealed unto your heart,
Interpreters, though much profound, Its subtle points cannot expound
The joy that Frankish wine does give, Lasts not for long nor always live,
Though scum at bottom of its bowl, Is always pure and never foul.
Knowledge and reason work in manner strange,
In case of Love ’gainst heart and sight they range.
The end of Muslim folk I know full well,
On theoretic points their preachers dwell.
Though bird of mead hovers my lodge around,
Yet has no share of my melodious sound.
The Turks, I hear, between the lines can read,
Who can this verse so odd convey with speed?
ʺYou take the West for neighbour sweet and dear,
Though Stars to land of yours are close and near.ʺ
The style may not he vivid and lively, still
Perhaps the meaning may penetrate thy mind:
The faith of men of God and ecstasy
Is like the call to prayer echoing in the skies;
The faith of the mullah, a vermin of the earth,
Is the telling of beads, and mumblings in the dust.
Estranging are the ways in the holy precinct,
And commercial is the tone of churches rites;
My soul's absorption is a relic now,
For gone are the days of men of ecstasy.
O wave! Plunge headlong into the dark seas,
And change thyself with many a twist and turn;
Thou wast not born for tile solace of the shore;
Arise, untamed, and find a path for thyself.
Am I bound by space, or beyond space?
A world—observer or a world myself'?
Let Him remain happy in His Infinitude,
But condescend to tell me where I am.
I was in the solitude of Selfhood lost,
And was, it seemed, unaware of the Presence;
I lifted not my eyes to see my Friend,
And, on the Day of Judgement, shamed myself
Confused is the nature of my love for Thee,
And more confused is my song in Thy praise;
For I sometimes do relish fulfilment,
At other times, a yearning in my heart.
Faith survives in fire, like Abraham,
Faith is the soul's absorption in the Lord;
For thee, upholder of the freedom of man,
A lack of faith is worse than slavery.
Observe the strains of' lily song:
An Indian voice a theme Arabian.,
An ear attuned to Western harmonies;
A royal temper, and the fate of a slave.
My nature is like the fresh breeze of morn:
Gentle sometimes, at other times strong;
I give a velvet mantle to flower petals,
And to prickly tborns, the sharpness of the needle.
A restless heart throb, in every atom;
It has its abode, alone, in a multitude;
Impaled upon the wheel., of days and nights,
It remains unchained by the tyranny of time.
Thy vision is not lofty, ethereal,
Thou dost not have the flight of a faith inspired;
Thou mayest be of an eagle breed, no doubt,
Thou dost not have those bold, piercing eyes.
Neither the Muslim nor his power survives;
The Sufi has outlived his radiant soul;
Ask God for the heart and soul of men of the past,
Become a fakir, first, to regain thy power.
Selfhood in the world of men is prophethood;
Selfhood in solitude is godliness;
The earth, the heavens, the great empyrean,
Are all within the range of Selfhood's power.
Distracted are thy eyes in myriad ways;
Distracted is thy reason in many pursuits;
Forsake not, O heart, thy morning sighs!
Chanting His name, thou mayest save thy soul.
The beauty of mystic love is shaped in song;
The majesty of mystic love is abandon;
The peak of mystic love is Hyder's power;
The decline of mystic love is Razi's word.
Where is the moving spirit of my life?
The thunder-bolt, the harvest of my life?
His place is in the solitude of the heart,
But I know not the place of the heart within.
I am not a pursuer, nor a traveller,
I am not a goal, but a narrow track,
I am not a harvest, but a thunder-bolt,
Born to set fire to straw.., buried in the dust.
Thy bosom has breath; it does not have a heart;
Thy breath has not the warmth and fire of life;
Renounce the path of reason; it is a light
That brightens thy way; it is not thy Final goal.
Pure in nature thou art, thy nature is light;
Thou art the star in the firmament;
Thou not an eagle of the King of Men,
Thy preys are the nymphs and the angels bright.
Muslims have lost the passion of love they had;
They are lily—livered, timid, and weak;
Their prayers are cold, unfelt, distracted rites;
They lack the inward fire of a burning faith.
Conquer the world with the power of Selfhood,
And solve the riddle of the universe;
Be intimate with thy shores, like the sea,
But avoid the surf around the boundless deep.
Dew—drops glisten on flowers that bloom in the spring;
The breeze, the jasmine, and the rose have failed
To raise the tumult of joy and liveliness,
For flowers here lack the spark and fire of life.
Reason is but a wayside lamp that gives
Eyes to the wayfarer on a dark night;
But what does this lamp on the wayside know
About the storms raging in the house?
Give the young, O Lord, my passionate love for Thee,
And give them an eagle's force to fly and to see;
O Lord, I pray that Thou vouchsafe to them
The power of vision that Thou hast given me.
Thine is the world of birds and beasts, O Lord!
And mine is the world of sighs by day and night;
I am a shackled slave in this world of Thine,
And Thou art the supreme ruler of my world.
Thank Thee, O Lord, I am not without talent born;
I am not a slave of kings and potentates;
Though born I am with a power to see the world,
I belong to none, like Jamsheed's all—seeing glass.
He is the essence of the worlds of space and spirit;
And what is the world of space? A style of speech.
If the fish ask Khizr where all the oceans lie,
Silence will be the guiding angel's answer.
Love is sometimes a wanderer in the woods;
At other times, a king of kings in power;
Sometimes an armed warrior in the field;
At other times defenceless, unarmed.
Love seeks sometimes the solitude of hills;
At other times, the tuneful chords of life;
Sometimes pent in the corner of a mosque,
At other times it fights like the Tiger of God.
Grant me the absorption of souls of the past,
And let me be of those who never grieve;
The riddles of reason I have solved, but now,
O Lord! Give me a life of ecstasy.
It was Abul Hassan who stressed the truth,
That the soul does not expire with the body's death;
How could the sun have any light at all,
If it spurns and loses its own beams?
This reason of mine knows not good from evil;
And tries to exceed the bounds that nature fixed;
I know not what has happened to me of late,
My reason and my heart are ever at war.
To be God is to do a million tasks;
To be God, no doubt, is a wearisome headache;
But-pardon me, O Lord-to be a man,
Is not a headache, but a heartache.
So man is the powerful lord of land and seas!
A lord of the world with an eye that hardly sees!
He knows neither himself, nor God, nor the world;
Is this, O Lord, Thy greatest masterpiece?
The mystic's soul is like the morning breeze;
It freshens and renews life's inner meaning
An illumined soul can be a shepherd's, who
Could hear the Voice of God at God's command.
That blood of pristine vigour is no more;
That yearning heart's power is no more;
Prayer, fasting, haj, sacrifice survive,
But in thee nature's old dower is no more.

The movement of days and nights is eternal, fast;
No one has seen the future or the past;
Thou art the only fact, the rest is fiction;
The present is the only time thou hast.
Selfhood's apostate is the life of reason;
Its secret lies in communion with God;
If thou couldst guard it in thy poverty,
Thou art indeed a fakir greater than kings.
Thy body knows not the secrets of thy heart,
And so thy sighs reach not the heights of heaven;
God is disgusted with bodies without souls;
The living God is the God of living souls.
Iqbal recited once in a garden in spring
A couplet cheerful and bright in tone and spirit:
Unlike the rose, I need no breeze to blossom.,
My soul doth blossom with my ecstasy.
My invocations are sincere and true,
They form my ablutions and prayers due.
One glance of guide such joy and warmth can grant,
On marge of stream can bloom the tulip plant.
One has no comrade on Love’s journey long
Save fervent zeal, and passion great and strong.
O God, at gates of rich I do not bow,
You are my dwelling place and nesting bough.
Your Love in my breast burns like Doomsday morn,
The cry, He is God, on my lips is born.
Your Love, makes me God, fret with pain and pine,
You are the only quest and aim of mine.
Without You town appears devoid of life,
When present, same town appears astir with strife.
For wine of gnosis I request and ask,
To get some dregs I break the cup and glass.
The mystics’ gourds and commons’ pitchers wait
For liquor of your Grace and Bounty great.
Against Your godhead I have a genuine plaint,
For You the Spaceless, while for me restraint.
Both verse and wisdom indicate the way
Which longing face to face can not convey.
Days’ and nights’ succession unfolds the scroll of events.
Days’ and nights’ succession is the essence of life and death
Days’ and nights’ succession is the twin-colours silks
With which the Almighty weaves the raiment of His attributes.
Days’ and nights’ succession is the sound of eternal music—
The celestial modulations denoting an infinite range.
It weighs the excellence of all thy deeds and mine;
Days’ and nights’ succession is the touchstone of our deeds.
If you're impure, if I'm impure
it leads to your funeral procession, it leads to my funeral procession
Our days are an illusion, our nights are a dream—
A current of time in which there is neither day nor night.
Wonders in the world of art are all devoured by time;
Mortal is man’s world! Mortal is man’s craft!
Destroyed is the first and last! Destroyed is the known, the unknown!
Destroyed at last is every work of antique form or new!
But immune from the shafts of time is the work of human hand,
When it has been conceived by impassioned men of God.
Love illumines every act of the men divinely inspired:
Love is the essence of life-, love dies not, but death.
Though the tide of’ time rises With mountain waves,
Love itself’ is a torrent, and resists all heaving storms.
In the almanac of love, besides the time that passes,
Are myriad other ages, untold and unnamed.
Love is Gabriel’s breath; love is the Prophet’s spirit;
Love is the apostle of God; love is the Word of God.
It is the passion of love that brightens the rose’s colour;
Love is the purest wine; love is the drink of saints.
Love is the law for the holy; love is the guide for the layman;
Love is the heart’s pilgrim, that visits in a thousand ways.
Love is the lyre that strikes the vibrant chord of life;
Love is the light of life; love is the flame of life.
O Holy Qartaba! Thou wast conceived in love—
Love that ever defies the laws of change and death.
Be it canvas, stone or bronze, harp or song or the Muse,
It is life-blood that nourishes marvels in the world of art.
It is life-blood that melts unmolten hearts of’ flint;
It is life-blood that turns the voice into ecstasy.
Thine is the beauty of light, mine is the song of fire.
Thy beauty exalts the heart; my song inspires the soul.
Man’s heart can reach the heights of the great empyrean,
Though his handful of dust cannot aspire beyond the skies.
What if the angels bright bow in eternal prayer?
They bow not with man’s passion, they bow not with his yearning
Though born of heathen stock, I have a fiery faith,
With prayer and durood in my heart, prayer and durood on my lips.
With passion in my soul, with passion in my song,
I sing a hymn to God through every fibre and vein.
O Qartaba! Thy beauty is a mirror of the man of God;
He has a beatific soul; thou hast a beatific form.
Thy myriad pillars are bright with a flame of power—
An avenue of grace in a paradise, on earth.
Thy edifice is bathed in a light serene, sublime;
Thy lofty minaret is a glimpse of Gabriel.
The Muslim will perish not, for the sound of his azan
Echoes the mystic voice of Moses and Abraham.
For him the earth has no bounds; limitless is his horizon;
Rivers of many clinics are waves of his unfathomed seas.
Marvellous are his annals, astonishing his deeds;
To people steeped in the past he opened vistas new.
Nourisher of noble arts, pioneer of passion;
He has the power of potent wine, the flash of a damascened sword.
He is a soldier impassioned, whose armour is his faith—
A faith that shields him ever in the din of clanging swords.
The secret of a Muslim’s heart is revealed in thy soul—
His heart’s consuming fire by day, his melting ecstasy by night;
His deeds sublime and noble, his thought flame-begotten;
With rapture in his soul, with modesty in his mien;
In every inspired act, like the act of God Himself
Victorious in action; beneficent, exalted.
Human, but angelic, man in the image of God;
Indifferent to both worlds, content with the Divine Will;
Humble in his hopes, lofty in his ideals;
A person charismatic in glance and word and deed.
Soft as a breeze in converse, hot as a furnace in quest;
Pure of heart, pure of conduct, in battle or in peace.
The faith of a man of God reflects the Will of God;
All else in this world is a mirage, a myth, a whim.
He is the goal of reason; he is’ the essence of love;
He is the warmth of life in the cold world of man.
Sacred for lovers of art, thou art the glory of faith;
Thou hast made Andalusia pure as a holy land;
Thy beauty, majestic, serene, has equal none on earth,
Except in the heart of a Muslim, true in his faith and, deeds.
Ah, those men of truth! Those horsemen of Arabia!
Models of noble courtesy, examples of true belief;
Whose rule oil the earth reveals, that tile rule of the men of God
Is the ascetic’s piety, and not the pomp of kings;
Whose lofty, inspired vision blessed the East and the West,
Whose wisdom was a beacon in Europe’s Dark Ages;
Who left an abiding imprint on the Andalusian mind:
A cheerful spirit and warmth, a simple, genial soul.
Abundant in this land today is gazelle-eyed beauty;
So are the shafts that pierce the heart from those gazelle eyes.
Wafted on its breeze still is Yemen’s aroma sweet;
And in its sights and sounds is the holiness of Hijaz.
In the eyes of the gazing stars thy earth is exalted as heaven;
Alas! for long thy walls have not echoed with the sound of azan.
Where, lost in hills and dales, in the twilight of time,
Are the thousand hearts aflame with the fiery passion of love?
The German soil has seen Reformation’s stormy waves,
Which battered and destroyed the bulwarks of the past.
The holy priest’s chastity was exposed as a myth;
New ideas were afloat, like a boat on perilous seas.
The French, too, have felt the raptures of a Revolution,
Which changed the Western mind in a topsy-turvy world.
The heirs of the Roman dream, no more in love with the past,
Now felt the urge of youth, cnamoured of the new.
The Muslim soul is now in the throes of a revolution,
Impelled by a mysterious, unknown divine decree.
Unknown is the shape of things to come in this storm and stress
Unknown is the fate of the world, unknown the divine decree.
The sun has vanished now under a crimson veil;
On the hill and in the valley, the twilight pales the clouds.
The peasant girl’s song is simple, poignant, sweet.
Youth is to a heart what current is to a boat.
O waters of Al-Kabeer! Someone on your shores
In the shades of evening, dreams of a dawning age.
The new age is shrouded yet in the mists and haze of the future,
But my inward eye has seen some glimpses of its dawn.
If I reveal my message, my thoughts, my beliefs,
Some will not endure the power of my prophecy.
Life is death if not impelled by the zeal of revolution;
The essence of a nation’s life is a passion for constant change.
A nation defies death like a sword that flashes amain,
When in every age it guards all its deeds.
Unsuffused with life-blood, no craft is ever complete;
Unsuffused with life-blood, a poet’s song is mere conceit.
In my breast, A wail of grief, Without any spark or flash,
Alone survives, Passionless, ineffectual.
A free man is in prison today, Without a spear or a sword;
Regret overwhelms me And also my strategy.
My heart Is drawn by instinct to chains.
Perhaps my sword was of the same steel.
Once I had a two‐edged sword– It turned into the chains that shackle me now.
How whimsical and indifferent, Is the Author of fates.
You are the apple of my eye,
My heart’s delight:
I am remote from my valley,
To me you are the Burning Bush of Sinai!
You are a houri of the Arabian Desert,
Nursed by the Western breeze.
I feel homesick in exile,
You feel homesick in exile:
Prosper in this strange land!
May the morning dew quench your thirst!
The world presents a strange sight:
The vision’s mantle is torn apart—
May valour struggle with the waves if it must,
The other side of the river is not to be seen!
Life owes itself to the heat of one’s soul:
Flame does not rise from dust.
The Syrian evening’s fallen star
Shined brighter in the exile’s dawn.
There are no frontiers for the Man of Faith,
He is at home everywhere.
Spain! You are the trustee of the Muslim blood:
In my eyes you are sanctified like the Harem.
Prints of prostration lie hidden in your dust,
Silent calls to prayers in your morning air.
In your hills and vales were the tents of those,
The tips of whose lances were bright like the stars.
Is more henna needed by your pretties?
My lifeblood can give them some colour!
How can a Muslim be put down by the straw and grass,
Even if his flame has lost its heat and fire!
My eyes watched Granada as well,
But the traveller’s content neither in journey nor in rest:
I saw as well as showed, I spoke as well as listened,
Neither seeing nor learning brings calm to the heart!
These warriors, victorious,
These worshippers of Thine,
Whom Thou hast granted the will
To win power in Thy name;
Who cleave rivers and woods in twain,
Whose terror turns mountains into dust;
They care not for the world;
They care not for its pleasures;
In their passion, in their zeal,
In their love for Thee, O Lord,
They aim at martyrdom,
Not the rule of the earth.
Thou hast united warring tribes,
In thought, in deed, in prayer.
The burning fire that life had sought
For centuries, was found in them at last.
They think of death, not as life’s end,
But as the ennobling of the heart.
Awaken in them an iron will,
And make their eye a sharpened sword.
All space and all that breathes bear witness; truth
It is indeed; Thou art, and dost remain.
How could I know that God was or was not,
Where Reason's reckonings shifted hour by hour?
The peerer at planets, the counter-up of plants,
Heard nothing there of Nature's infinite music;
To-day I witnessing acknowledge realms
That I once thought the mummery of the Church.
We, manacled in the chains of day and night!
Thou, moulder of all time's atoms, builder of aeons
Let me have leave to ask this question, one
Not answered by the subtleties of the schools,
That while I lived under the sky-tent's roof
Like a thorn rankled in my heart, and made
Such chaos in my soul of all its thoughts
I could not keep my tumbling words in bounds.
Oh, of what mortal race art Thou the God?
Those creatures formed of dust beneath these heavens?
Europe's pale checks are Asia's pantheon,
And Europe's pantheon her glittering metals.
A blaze of art and science lights the West
With darkness that no Fountain of Life dispels;
In high-reared grace, in glory and in grandeur,
The towering Bank out-tops the cathedral roof;
What they call commerce is a game of dice
For one, profit, for millions swooping death.
There science, philosophy, scholarship, government,
Preach man's equality and drink men's blood;
Naked debauch, and want, and unemployment
Are these mean triumphs of the Frankish arts
Denied celestial grace a nation goes
No further than electricity or steam
Death to the heart, machines stand sovereign,
Engines that crush all sense of human kindness.
-Yet signs are counted here and there that Fate,
The chess-player has check-mated all their cunning.
The Tavern shakes, its warped foundations crack,
The Old Men of Europe sit there numb with fear;
What twilight flush is left those faces now
Is paint and powder, or lent by flask and cup.
Omnipotent, righteous, Thou; but bitter the hours,
Bitter the labourer's chained hours in Thy world!
When shall this galley of gold's dominion founder?
Thy world Thy day of wrath, Lord, stands and waits.
As yet the Reason is unbridled, and Love is on the road:
O Architect of Eternity! Your design is incomplete.
Drunkards, jurists, princes and priests all sit in ambush upon Your common folk:
The days in Your world haven’t changed as yet.
Your rich are too unmindful, Your poor too content—
The slave as yet frets in the street, the master’s walls are still too high.
Learning, religion, science and art are all means to fulfill lust:
The grace of Love—the redeemer—is not as yet bestowed upon all.
The essence of Life is Love, the essence of Love is the self;
Alas! This cutting sword as yet rests in the sheath!
GOD'S COMMAND TO HIS ANGELS
RISE, and from their slumber wake the poor ones of My world
Shake the walis and windows of the mansions of the great!
Kindle with the fire of faith the slow blood of the slaves
Make the fearful sparrow bold to meet the falcon's hate!
Close the hour approaches of the kingdom of the poor—
Every imprint of the past find and annihilate!
Find the field whose harvest is no peasant's daily bread—
Garner in the furnace every ripening ear of wheat!
Banish from the house of God the mumbling priest whose prayers
Like a veil creation from Creator separate!
God by mm's prostrations, by man's vows are idols cheated-.
Quench at once in My shrine and their fane the sacred light!
Rear for me another temple, build its walls with mud—
Wearied of their columned marbles, sickened is My sight!
All their fine new world a workshop filled with brittle glass-
Go! My poet of the East to madness dedicate.

Life to passion and ecstasy—sunrise in the desert:
Luminous brooks are flowing from the fountain of the rising sun.
The veil of being is torn, Eternal Beauty reveals itself:
The eye is dazzled but the soul is richly endowed.
The heavy night‐cloud has left behind it red and blue cloudlets:
It has given a head‐dress of various hues to the Mount Idam to wear.
Air is clean of dust particles; leaves of datepalms have been washed;
The sand around Kazimah is soft like velvet.
The remains of burnt‐out fire are observable here and a piece of tent‐rope there:
Who knows how many caravans have passed through this tract.
I heard the angel Gabriel saying to me: This indeed is your station—
For those acquainted with the pleasure of separation, this is the everlasting comfort.
To whom should I say that the wine of life is poison to me:
I have new experiences while the universe is decadent entire.
Is there not another Ghaznavi in the factory of Life?—
The Somnaths of the People of the Harem have been awaiting a blow for long.
The Arabian fervour and the Persian comfort
Have both lost the Arabian acuteness and the Persian imagination.
The Caravan of Hijaz has not another Husain amongst it—
Although the tresses of the Tigris and the Euphrates are still as bright as ever.
Intellect, heart and vision, all must take their first lessons from Love—
Religion and the religious law breed idols of illusion if there is no Love.
The truthfulness of Abraham is but a form of Love, and so is the patience of Husain—
And so are Badr and Hunayn in the battle of existence.
The universe is a verse of God and you are the meaning to be grasped at last;
Colour and scent are the caravans that set forth to seek you.
The disciples in the schools are insipid and purblind;
The esoteric of the monastery have low aims with empty bowls;
I—whose ghazal reflects the flame that has been lost,
All my life I pined after the type of men that exists no more.
The zephyr nurtures thorn and straw,
While my breath nurtures passion in hearts;
My song thrives upon my lifeblood:
The strings of the instrument become alive with the blood of the musician.
Give not occasion for conturbation to this restless heart;
Bright are your tresses, brighten them even more.
You are the Sacred Tablet, You are the Pen and the Book;
This blue‐colored dome is a bubble in the sea that you are.
You are the lifeblood of the universe:
You bestowed the illumination of a sun upon the particles of desert dust.
The splendour of Sanjar and Selim: a mere hint of your majesty;
The faqr of Junaid and Bayazid: your beauty unveiled.
If my prayers are not led by my passion for you,
My ovation as well as my prostrations would be nothing but veils upon my soul.
A meaningful glance from you redeemed both of them:
Reason—the seeker in separation; and Love— the restless one in Presence.
The world has become dark since the sun has set down;
Unveil your beauty to dawn upon this age.
You are a witness on my life so far:
I did not know that Knowledge is a tree that bears no fruit.
The old battle was then revived in my conscience:
Love, all Mustafa; Reason, all Abu Lahab.
It persuaded me with art, it pulled me by force:
Strange is Love at the beginning, strange in its perfection!
Separation is greater than union in the state of ecstasy;
For union is death to desire while separation brings the pleasure of longing.
In the midst of the union I dared not cast a glance;
Though my audacious eye was looking for a pretence.
Separation is the warmth of hot‐pursuit; it is at the heart of fond lamentation—
It is why the wave is in search; it is why the pearl is precious.
THE MOTH
The firefly is so far removed, From the status of the moth!
Why is it so proud, Of a fire that cannot burn?
THE FIREFLY
God be thanked a hundred times, That I am, not a moth–
That I am no beggar, Of alien fire!
A nation’s life is illumined by selfhood,
Selfhood is the pathway to everlasting life.
This one thing that Adam is not without the Purpose—
A manifold life, a manifold leisure!
Earth‐bound crows cannot aspire to the eagle’s flights,
But they corrupt the eagle’s lofty, noble habits.
May God make thee a virtuous, blameless youth;
Thou livest in an age deprived of decency.
Iqbal was not at ease in a monastery,
For he is bright, and sprightly, and full of wit
A witty man in a tavern spoke with a tongue untamed:
‘The ruler of our state is a beggar unashamed;
How many go bare-headed to deck him with a crown?
How many go naked to supply his golden gown?
The blood of the poor turns into his red wine;
And they starve so that he may in luxury dine.
The epicure’s table is loaded with delights,
Stolen from the needy, stripped of all their rights.
He is a beggar who begs money, be it large or small,
Kings with royal pomp and pride, in fact, are beggars all.’
When in a vision I saw, A mullah ordered to paradise,
Unable to hold my tongue, I said something in this wise:
‘Pardon me, O Lord, For these bold words of mine,
But he will not be pleased, With the houris and the wine.
He loves to dispute and fight, And furiously wrangle,
But paradise is no place, For this kind of jangle.
His task is to disunite, And leave people in the lurch,
But paradise has no temple, No mosque and no church.’
Monasticism was the church’s base
Its austere living had no room for wealth.
The anchorite and the king have ever been hostile;
One has humility; the other an exalted power.
Church and state were separated at last;
The revered priest was rendered powerless.
When church and state parted the ways for ever,
It set in the rule of avarice and greed.
This split is a disaster both for country and faith,
And shows the culture’s blind lack of vision.
It is the miracle of a desert‐dweller
To make the grace a mirror to power.
Mankind’s deliverance lies in the unity
Of those who rule the body and those who rule the soul.
Who rears the seed in the darkness of the ground?
Who lifts the cloud up from the ocean wave?
Who drew here from the west the fruitful wind?
Who made this soil, or who that light of the sun?
Who filled with pearls of grain the tasselled wheat?
Who taught the months by instinct to revolve?
Landlord! this earth is not thine, is not thine,
Nor yet thy fathers' ; no, not thine, nor mine.
Thy sofas are from Europe, thy carpets from Iran;
This slothful opulence evokes my sigh of pity.
In vain if thou possessest Khusroe’s imperial pomp,
If thou dost not possess prowess or contentment.
Seek not thy joy or greatness in the glitter of Western life,
For in contentment lies a Muslim’s joy and greatness.
When an eagle’s spirit awakens in youthful hearts,
It sees its luminous goal beyond the starry heavens.
Despair not, for despair is the decline of knowledge and gnosis:
The Hope of a Believer is among the confidants of God.
Thy abode is not on the dome of a royal palace;
Thou art an eagle and shouldst live on the rocks of mountains.
An eagle, advanced in years, advised an eaglet thus:
O thou, whose wings may one day aspire to the heavens above,
Be consumed in the fire of thy own youthful blood;
Endurance sweetens all the sourness of life;
More pleasure there is in pouncing upon thy prey,
Than in sucking the blood from its vanquished stillness-.
This vast gray dome, This eerie solitude,
And this unbounded wilderness, Hold an uncanny fright for me.
I am a wanderer, lost, Thou art a wanderer, too,
Dost thou know thy goal, O wild flower— Dost thou know thy goal?
These mounts and hills are empty, Bereft of a vision-seeking Moses;
Though thou art a burning flame, And I am a burning flame.
Why didst thou part from thy roots? Why did I part from mine?
Was it the impulse to be born? Was it the impulse to be unique?
May God take care of those, Who plunge into the ocean of love,
For every drop of the ocean, Has the ocean’s depth.
The whirlpool mourns the wave, Swallowed up in its abyss—
The wave that rose from the sea’s depths, But never lapped against the shore.
It is man that has breathed, Life into this vacuous world,
The sun, the moon, and the stars, Are silent, passive spectators
O wild, wild wind! Bestow on me thy silence,
Thy pain and thy passion, Thy power and thy buoyancy.
Spring’s caravan has pitched its tent at the foot of the mountain,
making it look like the fabled garden of Iram
With a riot of flowers—iris, rose, Narcissus, lily, eglantine,
And tulip in its martyr’s gory shroud.
The landscape is all covered with a multicoloured sheet,
and colour flows even in the veins of stones like blood.
The breezes blow intoxicatingly in a blue sky,
so that the birds do not feel like remaining in their nests and fly about.
Look at that hill‐stream,
how It halts and bends and glides and swings around,
And then, collecting itself,
surges up and rushes on.
Should it be stemmed,
it would cut open the hills’ hearts and burst the rocks.
This hill‐stream, my fair saki, has
A message to give us concerning life.
Attune me to this message and,
Come, let us celebrate the spring, which comes but once a year.
Give me that wine whose heat burns up the veils of hidden things,
Whose light illuminates life’s mind,
Whose strength intoxicates the universe,
Whose effervescence was Creation’s source.
Come lift the veil off mysteries,
And make a mere wagtail take eagles on.
The times have changed; so have their signs.
New is the music, and so are the instruments.
The magic of the West has been exposed,
And the magician stands aghast.
The politics of the ancient regime are in disgrace:
world is tired of kings.
The age of capitalism has passed,
The juggler, having shown his tricks, has gone.
The Chinese are awaking from their heavy sleep.
Fresh springs are bubbling forth from Himalayan heights.
Cut open is the heart of Sinai and Faran,
And Moses waits for a renewed theophany.
The Muslim, zealous though about God’s unity,
Still wears the Hindu’s sacred thread around his heart.
In culture, mysticism, canon law and dialectical theology—
He worships idols of non‐Arab make
The truth has been lost in absurdities,
And in traditions is this ummah rooted still.
The preacher’s sermon may beguile your heart,
But there is no sincerity, no warmth in it.
It is a tangled skein of lexical complexities,
Sought to be solved by logical dexterity.
The Sufi, once foremost in serving God,
Unmatched in love and ardency of soul,
Has got lost in the maze of Ajam’s ideas:
At half‐way stations is this traveller stuck.
Gone out is the fire of love. O how sad!
The Muslim is a heap of ashes, nothing more.
O Saki, serve me that old wine again,
Let that old cup go round once more.
Lend me the wings of Love and make me fly.
Turn my dust to fireflies that flit about.
Free young men’s minds from slavery,
And make them mentors of the old.
The millat’s tree is green thanks to your sap:
You are its body’s breath.
Give it the strength to vibrate and to throb;
Lend it the heart of Murtaza, the fervour of Siddiq.
Drive that old arrow through its heart
Which will revive desire in it.
Blest be the stars of Your heavens; blest be
Those who spend their nights praying to You.
Endow the young with fervent souls;
Grant them my vision and my love.
I am a boat in a whirlpool, stuck in one place.
Rescue me and grant me mobility.
Tell me about the mysteries of life and death,
For Your eye spans the universe.
The sleeplessness if my tear‐shedding eyes;
The restless yearnings hidden in my heart;
The prayerfulness of my cries at midnight;
My melting into tears in solitude and company;
My aspirations, longings and desires;
My hopes and quests;
My mind that mirrors the times
A field for thought’s gazelles to roam
My heart, which is a battlefield of life,
Where legions of doubt war with faith—
O Saki, these are all my wealth;
Possessing them, I am rich in my poverty.
Distribute all these riches in my caravan,
And let them come to some good use.
In constant motion is the sea of life.
All things display life’s volatility.
It is life that puts bodies forth,
Just as a whiff of smoke becomes a flame.
Unpleasant to it is the company
Of matter, but it likes to see its striving to improve itself.
It is fixed, yet in motion,
straining at the leash to get free of the elements.
A unity imprisoned in diversity,
It is unique in every form and shape.
This world, this sex‐dimensioned idol‐house,
This Somnat is all of its fashioning.
It is not its way to repeat itself:
You are not I, I am not you.
With you and me and others it has formed
Assemblies, but is solitary in their midst.
It shines in lightning, in the stars,
In silver, gold and mercury.
Its is the wilderness, its are the trees,
Its are the roses, its are the thorns.
It pulverises mountains with its might,
And captures Gabriel and houris in its noose.
There is a silver‐grey, brave falcon here,
Its talons covered with the blood of partridges,
And over there, far from its nest,
A pigeon helplessly aflutter in a snare.
Stability is an illusion of eyes,
For every atom in the world pulsates with change.
The caravan of life does not halt anywhere,
For every moment life renews itself.
Do you think life is great mystery?
No, it is only a desire to soar aloft.
It has seen many ups and downs,
But likes to travel rather than to reach the goal;
For travelling is life’s outfit: it
Is real, while rest is appearance, nothing more.
Life loves to tie up knots and then unravel them.
Its pleasure lies in throbbing and in fluttering
When it found itself face to face with death,
It learned that it was hard to ward it off.
So it descended to this world, where retribution is the law,
And lay in wait for death.
Because of its love of duality, It sorted all things out in pairs,
And then arose, host after host, From mountains and from wilderness.
It was a branch from which flowers kept
Shedding and bursting forth afresh.
The ignorant think that life’s impress is
Ephemeral, but it fades only to emerge anew.
Extremely fleet‐footed, It reaches its goal instantly.
From time’s beginning to its end is but one moment’s way for it.
Time, chain of days and nights, is nothing but
A name for breathing in and breathing out.
What is this whiff of air called breath? A sword,
and selfhood is that sword’s sharp edge.
What is the self? Life’s inner mystery,
The universe’s waking up.
The self, drunk with display, is also fond
Of solitude;—an ocean in a drop.
It shines in light and darkness both;
Displayed in individuals, yet free from them.
Behind it is eternity without Beginning,
and before it is Eternity without an end; It is unlimited both ways.
Swept on by the waves of time’s stream,
And at the mercy of their buffeting,
It yet changes the course of its quest constantly,
Renewing its way of looking at things.
For it huge rocks are light as air:
It smashes mountains into shifting sand.
Both its beginning and its end are journeying,
For constant motion is its being’s law.
It is a ray of light in the moon and a spark in stone.
It dwells In colours, but is colourless itself.
It has nothing to do with more or less,
With light and low, with fore and aft.
Since time’s beginning it was struggling to emerge,
And finally emerged in the dust that is man.
It is in your heart that the Self has its abode,
As the sky is reflected in the pupil of the eye.
To one who treasures his self,
bread won at the cost of self‐respect is gall.
He values only bread,
he gains with head held high.
Abjure the pomp and might of a Mahmud;
Preserve your self, do not be an Ayaz.
Worth offering is only that prostration which
Makes all others forbidden acts.
This world, this riot of colours and of sounds,
Which is under the sway of death,
This idol‐house of eye and ear,
In which to live is but to eat and drink,
Is nothing but the Self’s initial stage.
O traveller, it is not your final goal.
The fire that is you has not come, Out of this heap of dust.
You have not come out of this world; It has come out of you.
Smash up this mountainous blockade,
Go further on and break out of this magic ring of time and space.
God’s lion is the self;
Its quarry are both earth and sky.
There are a hundred worlds still to appear,
For Being’s mind has not drained of its creative capabilities.
All latent worlds are waiting for releasing blows
From your dynamic action and exuberant thought.
It is the purpose of the revolution of the spheres
That your selfhood should be revealed to you.
You are the conqueror of this world Of good and evil.
How can I tell you The whole of your long history?
Words are but a strait‐jacket for reality:
Reality is a mirror, and speech, The coating that makes it opaque.
Breath’s candle is alight within my breast,
But my power of utterance cries halt.
Should I fly even a hairbreadth too high,
The blaze of glory would burn up my wings.
What was, has faded: what is, is fading: but of these words few can tell the worth;
Time still is gaping with expectation of what is nearest its hour of birth.
New tidings slowly come drop by drop from my pitcher gurgling of time’s new sights,
As I count over the beads strung out on my threaded rosary of days and nights.
With each man friendly, with each I vary, and have a new part at my command:
To one the rider, to one the courser, to one the whiplash of reprimand.
If in the circle you were not numbered, was it your own fault or mine?
To humour no‐one am I accustomed to keep untasted the midnight wine!
No planet‐gazer can ever see through my winding mazes; for when the eye
That aims it sees by no lights from Heaven, the arrow wavers and glances by.
That is no dawn at the Western skyline—it is a bloodbath, that ruddy glow!
Await to‐morrow; our yesterday and to‐day are legends of long ago.
From Nature’s forces their reckless science has stripped the garments away, until
At last its own nesting‐place is scorched by the restless lightning it cannot still:
To them the trade‐wind belongs, the sky‐way, to them the ocean, to them the ship—
It shall not serve them to calm the whirlpool by which their fate holds them in its grip!
But now a new world is being born, while this old one sinks out of sight of men,
This world the gamblers of Europe turned into nothing else than a gambling‐den.
That man will still keep his lantern burning, however tempests blow strong and cold,
Whose soul is centred on high, whose temper the Lord has cast in the royal mould.
Thy soul hath no rest, By day or by night,
Though thou art made of dust, Thy nature is mercurial.
Dust thou art, indeed, And to dust thou shalt return,
But thy nature links thy soul, With the sun, the moon, and the stars.
If thou couldst glimpse thy beauty, Even in a dream,
That morphean dream will be, Far nobler than awakening.
Thy musings and thy sighs, At the first streak of dawn—
A passion that sustains thee— Is the envy of our souls.
The essence of life unveils it self, In thy songs of love;
For thy harp is strung, By nature’s invisible hands.
Open thy eyes and look above,
Look at the streak of dawn;
Look at the veiling of the vision;
Look at the banishment unfair;
Look at the battle of hope and fear.
Thine are the clouds, the rains, the skies,
Thine are the winds, the storms,
The woods, the mountains, the rivers are thine;
The world of the angels was a void;
Look at the peopled earth, which is thine.
Thou wilt rule it like a king;
The stars will gaze in wonder;
Thy vision will encompass the earth;
Thy sighs will reach the heavens;
Look at the power of thy pain and passion.
The spark in thee is a radiant sun;
A new world lives in thee;
Thou carest not for a borrowed heaven;
Thy life‐blood has it concealed;
Look at the reward of anguish and toil.
Thy lyre has an eternal plaintive string,
Panting with the passion of love;
Thou guardest eternal secrets divine,
And livest a life of obedient power;
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Discerning eyes bleed in pain,
For faith is ruined by knowledge in this age.
RUMI
Fling it on the body, and knowledge becomes a serpent;
Fling it on the heart, and it becomes a friend.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE:
Master of love; of God!
I do remember thy noble words:
‘Wherefrom comes this Friendly voice—
Thin, feeble, and dry as a reed?’
The world today has an eternal sadness,
With neither joy, nor love, nor certitude,
What doth it know about this mystery—
Who is the friend, and what is the friend’s voice?
The sound of music is a dirge
In the West’s crumbling pageant.
RUMI
Every ear is not attuned to the word of truth,
As a fig suits not the palate of every bird.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
I have mastered knowledge of both the East and the West,
My soul suffers still in agony.
RUMI
Quacks sicken you more;
Come to us for a cure.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Thy glance of wisdom brightens my heart;
Explain to me the order for jihad.
RUMI
Break the image of God by the command of God,
Break the friend’s glass, with the friend’s stone.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Oriental eyes are dazzled by the West;
Western nymphs are fairer than those in Paradise.
RUMI
Silver glisters white and new,
But blackens the hands and clothes.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
The warm‐blooded youths in schools,
Alas, are victims of Western magic!
RUMI
When an unfledged bird begins its flight,
It becomes a ready feline morsel.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
How long this clash between church and state?
Is the body superior to the soul?
RUMI
Coins may jingle at night,
But gold waits for the morrow.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Tell me about the secret of man,
Tell how dust is a peer of the stars.
RUMI
His outside dies of an insect’s bite,
His inside roams the seven heavens.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Dust with thy help has a luminous eye,
Is man’s purpose knowledge or vision?
RUMI
Man is perception; the rest is skin;
Perception is the perception of God.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
The East lives on through your words!
Of what disease nations die?
RUMI
Every nation that perished in the past,
Perished for mistaking stone for incense.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Muslims have now lost their vigour and force;
Wherefore are they so timid and tame?
RUMI
No nation meets its doom,
Until it angers a man of God.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Though life is a mart without any lustre,
What kind of bargain doth offer some gain?
RUMI
Sell cleverness and purchase wonder;
Cleverness is doubt; wonder is perception.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
My peers consort with kings in court,
While I am a beggar, uncovered, bare‐headed.
RUMI
To be the slave of a man with an illumined heart,
Is better than to rule the ruler’s of’ the land.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
I am at a loss to know the puzzle
Of free will and determination.
RUMI
Wings bring a hawk to Kings;
Wings bring a crow to the grave.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
What is the aim of the Prophet’s path—
The rule of the earth, or a monastery?
RUMI
Prudence in our faith decrees war and power,
In the faith of Jesus—a cave and mount.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
How to discipline the body?
And how to awaken the heart?
RUMI
Be obedient, ride on the earth like a horse,
Not like a corpse borne on shoulders.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
The secret of faith I do not know;
How to believe in the Day of Judgement?
RUMI
Be the Judgement Day, and see the Judgement Day;
This is the condition for seeing everything.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
The selfhood soars up to the skies—
It preys upon the sun and the moon—
Deprived of the Presence, relying on existence, wearied:
Impoverished by its own preys.
RUMI
Love alone is fit to be hunted,
But who can ever ensnare it!
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Thou knowest the heart of the universe;
Tell how a nation can be strong?
RUMI
If thou art a grain, it will be picked by birds,
And if a blossom, it will be picked by urchins.
Hide thy grain, and be the trap;
Hide thy blossom, and be the grass.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
Thou callest me to seek the heart;
To be a seeker of the heart, and to be in a conflict;
My heart is in my breast,
Like a mirror, it shows my powers.
RUMI
Thou sayest thou hast a heart
The heart is not below, but in the empyrean,
Thou thinkest thy heart is a heart,
Forsaking the search for illumined hearts.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
My mind soars in ethereal flights,
But I grovel in the dust;
I have failed in the affairs of the world;
Kicks and buffets are my lot;
Why is material world beyond my reach?
Why are the wise in faith, fools in the world?
RUMI
One who can scale the heights of heaven,
Can tread the path of earth with ease.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
What is the secret of knowledge and wisdom?
And how to be blessed with passion and pain?
RUMI
Knowledge and wisdom are born of honest living;
Love and ecstasy are born of honest living.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
The world demands me to meet and mingle,
But the song is born in solitude.
RUMI
Keep away from strangers, not from Him,
Wrap thyself for winter, not for spring.
THE INDIAN DISCIPLE
India now has no light of vision or yearning;
Men of illumined hearts have fallen on evil days.
RUMI
Imparting heat and light is the task of the brave;
Cunning and shamelessness are the refuge of the mean.
Gabriel:
Satan:
My old friend, How is the world of sight and sound?
Pain and passion; quest and yearning.
Gabriel:
Thou never talkest of anything but the heavens.
Is there no cure for thy constant pain?
Satan:
Thou knowest not, alas, the secret of my pain!
The loss I have suffered, has increased my passion more-,
How silent is this world; desolate and wild!
I cannot ever live here; I cannot!
For one whose despair throbs in the heart of the universe,
What is better-despair, or hope?
Gabriel:
By thy refusal thou hast lost thy place in heaven—
And disgraced the angels in the eyes of the Lord.
Satan:
With my boldness I make this handful of dust rise up.
My mischief weaves the garment that reason wears.”
From the shore you watch the clash of good and evil.
Which of us suffers the buffets of the storms—you or I?
Both Khizr and Ilyas feel helpless:
The storms I have stirred up rage in oceans, rivers, and streams.
If you are ever alone with God, ask Him:
Whose blood coloured the story of Adam?
I rankle in God’s heart like a thorn. But what about you?
All you do is chant ‘He is God’ over and over!
One night in a vision, I saw a morning star,
Asking the stars if they saw man ever awake.
Mercury Said, ‘Destiny has wisely decreed,
That this impish trouble maker should always be asleep.’
Satan replied ill disdain ‘Let us mind our business;
Thus night-blind insect is beneath our contempt.’
The full moon said, ‘He is a star of the earth;
You appear by night, and he appears by day;
‘This handful of dust, when keeping awake at night,
Is loftier than the galaxies in heaven;
‘He has a beatific light Concealed in his soul—
A light that will eclipse the brightest stars and planets.’
Then came the echoing thunder of the sound of azan-
The thunder which gives shivers to mountains’ hearts.
The shafts of love are not confined
To clime or race or creed.
What teaches a king the ways of a slave,
Is not love, but something else.
Knowledge and wisdom are jugglery
Without the alchemy of love.
Love is freedom and contentment,
Not at the mercy of kingly power.
My poverty is better than imperial pomp,
One maketh man, the other maketh glass.
I fear not the darkness of the night;
My nature is bred in purity and light;
Wayfarer of the night! Be a lamp to thyself;
With thy passion’s flame, make thy darkness bright.
Create a place for thyself in the world of love;
Create a new age, new days, and new nights.
If God grant thee an eye for nature’s beauty,
Converse with the silence of flowers; respond to their love.
Do not be beholden to the West’s artisans,
Seek thy sustenance in what thy land affords.
My ghazal is the essence of my life-blood,
Create thy elixir of life out ‘of this essence.
My way of life is poverty, not the pursuit of wealth;
Barter not thy Selfhood; win a name in adversity.
Wherefore this succession of day and night?
And what are the sun and the starry heavens?
Am I in my land or in banishment?
The vastness of this desert fills me with fright.
I know not the enigma of this life of mine;
I know not where to find one who knows.
Avicenna wonders where he came from;
And Rumi wonders where he should go.
‘With every wayfarer I pace a little;
I know not yet who my leader is.’
We venture not beyond the shores— Being to the senses confined.
But Rumi is an ocean, Stormy, mysterious.
Iqbal! Thou, too, art moving, In that band of men--
That band of men of passion, Of which Rumi is the guide,
Rumi, they say, Is the guiding light for freedom;
Has he, indeed, a message, For the age we live in?
REPLY
‘Eat not hay and corn like donkeys;
Eat of thy choice like the musk-deer;
He dies who eats hay and corn,
He who eats God’s light, becomes the Quran.’
The destiny of the world, Is a mystery unknown;
It is the force of character, That unlocks its heart.
It was the force that powered, Alexander’s mighty sword—
The sword that shattered all, That came in its way.
It was the force that launched, Tamburlaine’s conquering hordes—
The hordes that swept through, Rivers and hills and dales.
The call to prayer by men of God, In the battle front,
Through the power of character, Becomes the voice of God.
But the body’s valour, And the power of will,
After a moment’s pause, Are swallowed up by the grave.
‘The vale of silence is, The final goal of our journey;
Raise a tumult, when alive, Under the starlit dome.’
What is the originality of thought and action?—a taste for revolution.
What is the originality of thought and action?—the age of youth for a nation.
Originality of thought and action creates miracles of life:
It turns pebbles into ruby stones.
O Great Rome! Your conscience has changed altogether:
Is this a dream I see or is this for real!
Your old have the gleam of life in their eyes;
The flame of desire warms up the hearts of your young.
This warmth of love, this longing and this self‐expression:
Flowers cannot hide themselves in the season of Spring.
Songs of passion fill your air now—
The instrument of your nature was awaiting someone to play on it!
Whose benevolent eye has graced this miracle upon you?
He whose vision is like the light of the Sun!
A self‐respecting tramp was saying to the Almighty:
I dare not complain for my woes of poverty;
But pray tell me if it is by Your permission
That the angels bestow riches upon the worthless ones?
What is this life of yours, tell me its mystery—
Trampled. in dust is your ages-old history!
Deep in that dust has been smothered your flame—
Wake, and hear dawn its high summons proclaim
Creatures of dust from the soil may draw bread:
Not in that darkness is Life's river fed!
Base will his metal be held, who on earth
Puts not to trial his innermost worth!
Break all the idols of tribe and of caste,
Break the old customs that fetter men fast
Here is true victory, here is faith's crown—
One creed and one world, division thrown down
Cast on the soil of your clay the heart's seed
Promise of harvest to come, is that seed
Laden with pearls departed from the presence-hall of God
That cloud that makes the pulse of life stir in the rose-bud's vein
And on its way saw Paradise, and trembled with desire
That on such exquisite abode it might descend in rain.
A voice sounded from Paradise: 'They wait for you afar,
Kabul and Ghazni and Herat, and their new-springing grass;
Scatter the tear from Nadir's eye on the poppy's burning scar,
That never more may be put out the poppy's glowing fire!
Let the tribes be lost in the unity of the nation,
So that the Afghans gain prestige!
The youth to whom the stars are not out of bounds
Are the ones I love indeed—
In no way is this child of the mountains,
Inferior to the Mughal.
May I tell you my secret, O Comrade:
Khush‐hal Khan would much like that his burial place
Be far from the reaches of the dust blown by the Mughal cavalry,
Carried by the mountain wind.
Prayer-mat and priestly turban have turned footpad,
With wanton boys' bold glances men are flattered;
The Church's mantle and the creed in shreds,
The robe of State and nation torn and tattered.
I cling to faith-but may its spark not soon
Lie quenched under these rubbish-heaps thick-scattered!
Bokhara's humble dust and Samarkand's
The turbulent billows of many winds have battered.
A gem set in a ring of misery
That circles me on every side, am I.
Suddenly quivered the dust of Samarkand,
And from an ancient tomb a light shone, pure
As the first gleam of daybreak, and a voice
Was heard:-'I am the spirit of Timur!
Chains may hold fast the men of Tartary,
But God's firm purposes no bonds endure
Is this what life holds-that Turania's peoples
All hope in one another must abjure ?
Call in the soul of man a new fire to birth!
of Cry a new revolution over the earth!
When the heart is enlightened,
It is blessed with an inward eye.
The initiate has a different level
Of space and time in each position.
The mullah’s and the crusader’s azan,
The same in words, are apart in spirit.
The vulture and the eagle soar
In the same air, but in worlds apart.
It is said that Ma‘arri never ate meat;
He lived on fruit and vegetables.
A friend sent him a roasted partridge,
To allure that clever gentleman into eating meat.
When Ma‘arri saw that elegant tray
He, the author of Ghufran
“O You helpless little bird, would you tell me your sin
For which this punishment has been awarded to you?
Alas, you did not become a falcon;
Your eye did not perceive the directives of Nature.
It is the eternal decree of the Judge sitting in Judgement on destinies—
That weakness is a crime punishable by death.
Cinema—or new fetish‐fashioning,
Idol‐making and mongering still?
Art, men called that olden voodoo—
Art, they call this mumbo‐jumbo;
That—antiquityʹs poor religion:
This—modernityʹs pigeon‐plucking;
That—earthʹs soil: this—soil of Hades;
Dust, their temple; ashes, ours.
I stood by the Reformerʹs tomb: that dust
Whence here below an orient splendour breaks,
Dust before whose least speck stars hang their heads,
Dust shrouding that high knower of things unknown
Who to Jehangir would not bend his neck,
Whose ardent breath fans every free heartʹs ardour,
Whom Allah sent in season to keep watch
In India on the treasure‐house of Islam.
I craved the saintsʹ gift, other‐worldliness
For my eyes saw, yet dimly. Answer came:
“Closed is the long roll of the saints; this Land
Of the Five Rivers stinks in good menʹs nostrils.
Godʹs people have no portion in that country
Where lordly tassel sprouts from monkish cap;
That cap bred passionate faith, this tassel breeds
Passion for playing pander to Government.”
Ranks must be determined for this game;
Let you be the firzine and I the pawn by the grace of the chess‐player.
The pawn, indeed, is an insignificant token,
Even the farzine is not privy to the chessplayer’s strategy.
There is a faqr that teaches the hunter to be a prey;
There is another that opens the secrets of mastery over the world.
There is a faqr that is the root of needfulness and misery among nations;
There is another that turns mere dust into elixir.

Barter not thy selfhood for silver and gold;
Sell not a burning flame for a spark half‐cold;
So says Firdowsi, the poet of vision and grace,
Who brought to the East the dawn of brighter days:
Be not a churl for filthy lucre’s sake,
Count not thy coppers, whatever they may make.
The sun is weaving with golden thread
A mantle of light about earthʹs head;
Creation hushed in ecstasy,
As in the presence of the Most High.
What can these know—stream, hill, moon, star—
Of separation’s torturing scar?
Mine is this golden grief alone,
To this dust only is this grief known.
Talking in signs and symbol is not for this age,
And I know not the art of artful sniggers;
No more are those who said: Rise, in God’s name!
The ones alive are sweepers and grave‐diggers.
To the Lord of the universe the Devil said:—
A firebrand Adam grows, that pinch of dust
Meager‐souled, plump of flesh, in fine clothes trussed,
Brain ripe and subtle, heart not far from dead.
What the East’s sacred law made men abjure,
The casuist of the West pronounces pure;
Knowest Thou not, the girls of Paradise see
And mourn their gardens turning wilderness?
For fiends its rulers serve the populace:
Beneath the heavens is no more need of me!
If blood is warm in the body, there is no fear nor anxiety,
And the heart is free of tribulations.
The one who has received this bounty
Is neither greedy for wealth nor miserable in poverty.
The tree said to a bird of the desert one day:
“Creation is founded on the principle of injustice;
For the Creation could have been so much more pleasant
If I had also been granted the gift of flight.”
The bird gave him a good reply:
“Woe! You regard justice to be injustice;
He is not entitled to fly in this world,
Whoever is not free from earth‐rootedness.”
The headmaster is an architect
Whose material is the human soul.
A good advice has been left for you
By the sage Qa‘ani:
Do not raise a wall against the Sun
If you wish the courtyard illuminated.”
He could fly high but he wasn’t daring and passionate,
The sage remained a stranger to the secret of Love.
The vulture roamed around the air like an eagle,
But could not get acquainted with the taste of a fresh prey.
I have turned away from that place on earth
Where sustenance takes the form of grain and water.
The solitude of the wilderness pleases me—
By nature I was always a hermit—
No spring breeze, no one plucking roses, no nightingale,
And no sickness of the songs of love!
One must shun the garden‐dwellers—
They have such seductive charms!
The wind of the desert is what gives
The stroke of the brave youth fighting in battle its effect.
I am not hungry for pigeon or dove—
For renunciation is the mark of an eagle’s life.
To swoop, withdraw and swoop again
Is only a pretext to keep up the heat of the blood.
East and West ‐these belong to the world of the pheasant,
The blue sky—vast, boundless—is mine!
I am the dervish of the kingdom of birds—
The eagle does not make nests.
Not a rushlight for us,—in our Master’s
Fine windows electric lights blaze!
Town or village, the Muslim’s a duffer—
To his Brahmins like idols he prays.
Not mere gifts—compound interest these saints want,
In each hair‐shirt a usurer’s dressed,
Who inherits his seat of authority
Like a crow in the eagle’s old nest.
Harun said to his son when his hour came,
“You’ll will also pass this way some day.
The Angel of Death is an unseen to the infidel,
But it is not hidden from a Muslim’s eyes.”
Transcend the intellect if you have courage to do so:
There are islands hidden in the ocean of the self as yet.
The secrets of this silent sea, however, do not yield
Until you cut it with the blow of the Moses’ rod.
The Jewish money‐lenders, whose cunning beats the lion’s prowess,
Have been waiting hopefully for long.
Europe is ready to drop like a ripe fruit,
Let’s see in whose bag it goes.
Falling down is the destiny of that bird
Whose duality of nature renders him unable to fly.
Not every heart is an abode to the trusty Gabriel,
Nor can every thought ensnare the Paradise like a bird.
The ecstasy of thought is dangerous in a nation
Where the individuals observe no rule.
Though God‐gifted intellect is the lamp of an age,
The freedom of thought is a Satanic concept.
THE LION
You are so different and unlike, All the other dwellers of the wild and the desert!
Who are your parents and ancestors? And what is your tribe?
THE MULE
Perhaps your highness does not know, My uncle—my motherʹs brother:
He gallops like the wind, and is, The pride of the royal stable!
THE ANT
I am so miserable and forlorn—
Why is your station loftier than the skies?
THE EAGLE
You forage about in dusty paths;
The nine heavens are as nothing to me!

The mentor exhorted his. disciples once:
Listen to my words, in value greater than gold:
The Western wine is poison for the people,
When the offspring knows neither pride nor skill.
The morn that shifts so soon tomorrow new,
Whence it comes is only known to few:
The dark abode of being is shook by morn,
Which by Muslimʹs call to prayer is born.
The secret of the self is hid, In words ʺNo god but He alone.ʺ
The self is just a dull‐edged sword, ʺNo god but He,ʺ the grinding stone.
An Abraham by the age is sought, To break the idols of this Hall:
The avowal of Godʹs Oneness can, Make all these idols headlong fall.
A bargain you have struck for goods, Of life, a step, that smacks conceit,
All save the call ʺNo god but Heʺ, Is merely fraught with fraud and deceit.
The worldly wealth and riches too, Ties of blood and friends a dream
The idols wrought by doubts untrue, All save Godʹs Oneness empty seem.
The mind has worn the holy thread, Of Time and Space like pagans all
Though Time and Space both illusive, ʺNo god but Heʺ is true withal.
These melodious songs are not confined, To Time when rose and tulip bloom
Whatever the season of year be, ʺNo god but Heʺ must ring till doom.
Many idols are still concealed, In their sleeves by the Faithful Fold,
I am ordained by Mighty God, To raise the call and be much bold.
The Quranic teaching that did bring, The Moon and Pleiades within human
Is now explained in manner strange, ’Twixt man and world to cause a breach.
Their mode of work has changed entire, Before the freaks of Fate they bow:
They had a say in what God decreed, But Muslims have now fallen low.
What was so evil has by steps, Put on the shape of good and fine:
In state of bondage, as is known, The shift of conscience is quite sure.
A mote endowed with strong desire for flight
Can reach the Sun and Moon with effort slight.
If chest of partridge fire and zeal emit,
My friends, in fight with hawk it can acquit.
Ascension means to gauge a Muslimʹs heart,
The Pleiades are the target of his dart.
No wonder, meanings of Najm from you hide,
On Moon depends your oceanʹs ebb and tide.
If your self had not been debased and lost,
Bergson, his spell on you would not have cast.
Hegelʹs shell is quite devoid of gem that gleams,
His talisman merely web of fancy seems.
Manʹs need is how this earthly life to brace,
He yearns that self may last ʹyond Time and Space.
To have a life steadfast is his desire,
He seeks some rules to guide his life entire.
The source, that gloom dispels, spreads light around,
Is worship call at morn with clarion sound.
I am by breed a pure and trite Somnati,
Ancestors mine were both Lati and Manati.
You hail from Hashemite Prophetʹs race,
My origin from Brahmans I have to trace.
Philosophy is my bodyʹs essential part,
It is rooted deep in fibres of my heart.
Iqbal devoid of skill and craft though be,
Through every vein of thought can fully see.
The frenzy in your breast is shorn of glow,
This heart illuming point you ought to know.
Intellect leads a man from God astray,
Philosophy from grasping facts keeps away.
Dumb strains produced by calm and serious thought
Slay zeal for active life and achieve not aught.
True faith and creed give strength to earthly life,
Abraham and Prophetsʹ Seal guide to face its strife.
Aliʹs son, you are deceived by Avicennaʹs thought,
Give ears to what the Holy Prophet taught.
You can not see the path you have to tread,
So choose a guide from tribe of Quraysh instead.
Perhaps the part of year that Spring you deem,
In othersʹ view destructive Autumn it may seem!
The worldly affairs one pattern donʹt retain,
So pilgrim wise, think not of loss and gain!
The thing you take for sky of earthly tract,
Perhaps is soil of some other world in fact!
Though wealth and gold provide, The worldly needs of man
But what faqr can bestow, No wealth or gold eʹer can.
If youth of nation mine, Were jealous of their creed,
My qalandarʹs state wonʹt mind, Alexanderʹs might indeed.
With ease you can divine, To some thing else is due:
Penury can not cause, Decline of Muslims True.
Wealth has played no part, To bring my worth to light
My faqr this spell has cast, The share of wealth is slight.
Knowledge said to me, Love is madness;
Love said to me, Knowledge is calculation—
O slave of calculation, do not be a bookworm!
Love is Presence entire, Knowledge nothing but a Veil.
The universe is moved by the warmth of Love;
Knowledge deals with the Attributes, Love is a vision of the Essence;
Love is peace and permanence, Love is Life and Death:
Knowledge is the rising question, Love is the hidden answer.
Kingdom, faith and faqr are all miracles of Love;
The crowned kings and lords are base slaves of Love;
Love is the Space and the Creation, Love is Time and Earth!
Love is conviction entire, and conviction is the key!
The luxury of destination is forbidden in the religion of Love;
Fighting the storms is permitted, but the comfort of the shore is forbidden;
Lightning is permitted to Love, Harvest is forbidden.
Knowledge is the child of the Book, Love is the mother of the Book.
There is no place in Ind wherefrom to learn, The tenets that the Muslim Faith concern.
They are devoid of zeal for godly acts, And are not wont to seek its basic facts.
The mystics, who were keen their faith to spread, Are silent now and thought for them a dread.
Alas! the state of bondage deprives of zest, Slaves tread the beaten path and relinquish quest.
The jurists are helpless to such extent, Canʹt change themselves but would change Quranʹs content.
How sad, the jurists canʹt shift their outlook, But would prefer to change the Holy Book!
These abject slaves opine and cling to creed, That Holy Book is full of flaws indeed.
They think it incomplete for this fact, Because it fails to teach the slavish tact.
Though unwise, thanks to God I must express
For bonds with celestial world that I possess.
My songs fresh zeal to hearts of men impart,
Their charm extends to lands that lie apart.
In Autumn my breath makes birds that chirp in morn,
Imbibe much joy and feel no more forlorn.
O God, to such a land I have been sent,
Where men in abject bondage feel content.
These are all a wayfarer’s search posts
about whom the Quran says: He taught all the names.
The achievements of Rumi and ‘Attar are stations of dhikr;
the computations of Bu ‘Ali Sina pertain to the station of fikr.
To measure time and space is the station of fikr,
to recite: Exalted be my Lord, Most High is the station of dhikr.
I do not wonder if, To God you find approach:
You know not rank of man, For which you need reproach.
Your worship is devoid, Of grandeur, charm and grace:
Your Call to Prayer at morn, Leaves cold and does not brace
Oft men who donʹt deserve get might and main,
Anon a Personʹs gifts ungraced remain.
Perhaps some rules of Logic are concealed,
Mishaps that lie in wait are not revealed.
There is a fact that all of us can know,
World annals much light on this matter throw.
Fate keeps its eye on what the nations do,
Like two‐edged sword can riddle through and through.
Tauhid has been a living force in the days bygone;
what is it these days? Merely a topic of theology.
If its glory doesn’t make the darkness of character radiant,
Muslim cannot judge his elevated position.
Chief of warriors, I have witnessed your array;
their sheaths are devoid of the sword of Say: He is Allah.
Ah! Neither mullah nor faqih envisages the fact that
Unity of thought without unity of action is imperfect.
What is a nation, or how to lead it?
What clue these leaders of prayers could have of that!
Learning whom God has made, The mate of heart and sight,
Like Friend of God can break, With ease all idols bright.
Cosmos and life are one, The world is one and same
The tale of old and new, Is merely false and lame.
A blossom can not thrive, In meadow full of trees,
Unless some drops of dew, Ally with pleasant breeze.
That ken is vision dim, In which the wise manʹs lore
And sight that Moses viewed, Keep apart and merge no more.
Brahmans dub him as foe to native land,
The English call him beggar on the other hand.
The code of prophet born in Punjab says,
ʺThis ancient Muslim owns many pagan ways.”
When and whence the call to truth shall rise,
“My humble heart is feeling much surprise?”
O Muslim, did you ever think or feel
What is meant by piercing sword of steel?
It is the first hemistich of this verse
That Godʹs Oneness shows in form so terse.
My anxiety for the second half is greater though,
May God the sword of faqr on you bestow
If Muslim true can get this sword in hold
He is Ali the Lion of God, or Khalid bold.
This is an age, our canonist’s new dictum, Assures us, of the pen:
In our world now, The sword has no more virtue.
Has it not reached Our pious oracle’s ear,
That in the Mosque Such sermonizing nowadays has grown Rhymeless and reasonless?
Where, in a Muslim’s hand, Will he find dagger or rifle?
And if there were, Our hearts have lost all memory of delight In death.
To one whose nerves falter at even An infidel cut down,
who would exclaim ‘Die like a Muslim!’
Preach relinquishment Of such crusades
To him whose bloody fist Menaces earth!
Europe, swathed cap‐a‐pie In mail,
Mounts guard over her glittering reign Of falsehood;
we enquire of our divine, So tender of Christendom: if for the East
War is unhallowed, is not war unhallowed, For Western arms?
And if your goal be truth, Is this the right road—Europe’s faults all glossed,
And all Islam’s held to so strict an audit?
Autocrats like Alexander and Genghis, Have trampled men beneath their feet,
Not once but hundred times so far, They brought man down from honoured seat.
The annals right from history’s dawn, The message eternal bear as such,
“O man, with insight great endowed, The wine of might is dangerous much.ʺ
Before this quickly flowing flood, That spreads to all the tracts with speed:
Art, insight, intellect and science, Are carried along like straw and reed.
Divorced from faith, a poison strong, When propped by faith and true belief,
’Gainst poison works with speed, And proves a source of much relief.
Faqr goes to War unequipped, unarmed with glee,
It deals dire blows, if heart of sins is free.
Its defiance and unrest, ever on increase
Give tale of Moses and Pharoah fresh release.
O zealous faqr, you will get your grandeur old,
The Frankish soul is stained with greed of wealth and gold.
Ecstatic Love forbids control of heart
Without breeze the petals do not part.
The fire and light of ego both, The soul of Muslims together bind;
The fire of self is light for life: Godʹs existence brings before the mind.
It fortifies the things of life, It is the cause of all display:
Though Nature always hides this soul, From eyes of mankind far away.
If Muslim Faith offends the West, Let West in its own anger burn:
This faith is known by other name, To ʹJealous Faqrʹ now we must turn.
Life is a like a shell and ego like a drop of April shower—
It is unbecoming a shell if it cannot turn the drop into a pearl.
If the ego is self‐preserving, self‐creating and self‐sustaining,
Then it is possible that even death may not make you die.
The lofty states of faqr are known to few,
The faqr that brings the soul of Quran to view.
When selfhood sees its sway and upper hand,
This exalted state the folk as kingship brand.
This rank gives verdict of a Muslimʹs worth,
And makes him vicegerent of God on earth.

You have got bondage as a fit reward,
For you have failed to keep on faqr a guard.
Prostration made like moon his forehead shine,
Alas! the Franks have snatched that essence fine.
Your stars have lost their pristine glow and sheen
That made them rivals of Sun and Moon so keen.
Your eyes are fixed on miracles that amaze,
But world of events strange attracts my gaze.
No doubt, the world of thought is strange and queer,
But worlds of Life and Death more odd appear.
A call to you is sent by World of Chance,
Perhaps you may transmute it with your glance.
1
Your light is only Europe’s light reflected:
You are four walls her architects have built,
A shell of dry mud with no tenant soul,
An empty scabbard chased with flowery gilt.
2
To your mind God’s existence seems unproved:
Your own existence seems not proved to mine.
He whose self shines like a gem, alone exists;
Take heed of it! I do not see yours shine.
If angelic art and celestial lore, The ills of Muslims can not cure,
Worthless they are and of no use, Of fact so true you must be sure.
Your reveries deep and rapture sweet, Your worship at the midst of night,
If fail to keep a watch on self, Are useless quite and have value slight.
The intellect can cast its noose, On the Pleiades and the Moon;
If heart is bʹreft of love for God, It is not a worthy gift and boon.
If wit incites a man to say, ʺNo God but Heʺ it brings no gain:
It. has no worth at all I think, Unless affirmed by heart and brain.
No wonder great that my discourse, With distraction unbound is fraught:
If it wonʹt spread like rays of morn, It means such talk has value naught!
Only identity of thought, Keeps the Faith thriving—
Doctrine by whose means schism is brought, Is impious striving;
And only the strong hand is fit, To guard the creed:
Let no‐one trust man’s native wit, To serve such need.
But that strength, preacher, we shall not, Find in your hand muster;
Go, and recite in some cool grot, Your paternoster—
And there concoct some new Islam, Whose mystic kernel
Shall be a tame submissive calm, Despair eternal!
—In India, if bare leave be deigned, His prayer‐prostration,
Our dull priest thinks Islam has gained Emancipation.
A heart devoid of love is dead, Infuse fresh life in it again:
It is the only cure for folk, Who suffer from some chronic pain.
Your sea is full of calm and rest, Is it repose or magic art?
No sharks and storms disturb your sea, Intact its coast in every part!
You are not intimate with laws, That rule the spheres that spin around:
The twinkling stars do not disturb, The calm which in your heart is found!
The dormant spark that buried lay, In my extinguished clay since long
Has set afire your bed of reeds, Assuming form of morning song!
That man can only see in full, The world of future and the past,
Who has the luck to be endowed with, With my glance so pert and fast!
The diverse hues of world I can descry,
Here stone and gem, there moon and starry sky.
My insight also gives this verdict clear,
These are hills, river, earth and sphere.
Of facts so true, I strive to hide not aught:
You are, all else a trick that eyes have wrought!
In different garbs and various masks, The idols reappear in every age:
They e’er retain their youth and gloss, Though man has grown old on this stage.
Prostration ’fore God you presume, As irksome, tedious, burden great;
But mind, this homage sets you free, From bonds of men, of might who prate!
Poor intellect canʹt be fit, To be your guide in life:
If led by guess and doubt, Disruption may get rife.
Your zeal infirm and weak, Unlit your thoughts by light:
It is too hard to illume, Your lifeʹs dark dismal night.
’Twixt actions good and bad, Itʹs hard to draw a line,
Unless life undertakes, Such subtle points to define.
The mystics of the present age, Are devoid of warriorʹs rage:
The claim that they are rapt with wine, Of ’Last and turn from Code Divine!
The jurist has such bent of mind, That makes to monkish mode inclined,
In Holy Wars take rock‐like stand, They are just combats hand to hand.
Manʹs flight from conflicts of life, Or escape from its heat and strife:
If these not be abject defeat, What else is then a mean retreat?
Clay‐made man and angelic hosts, All are swayed by wit and mind:
Naught lies beyond the reach of wit, Bestowed by God benign and kind.
Its lasting grandeur holds the world, In perpetual chains that do not break:
The heart alone some courage shows, And full of rage at wit can shake.
The mystic mode has naught except, The inner changes of the heart;
The talk of Mullah on his creed, Is merely piece of fiery art.
The poetʹs song of zeal bereft, Is dead and struck with frost!
To outward eyes he seems awake, Though in thoughts completely lost!
Alas! my eyes do not behold, The holy knight whose fervour high
May cause his blood to seethe and boil, In veins that lend such might to thigh.
A dervish feels no rest at all, Beneath the mound of clods and dust:
Though abysmal dark the grave, Its rigours yet bear he must.
In dark and dismal depths of grave, Silence of skies a man can sense,
But there he can never find, Environs free and space immense.
A Dervish bold proclaims with main and might
My guidance take, tread path quite straight and right!
Beyond your might and nerves my tumults lie,
With caution great by qalandarʹs dwelling hie!
The help of skiff and guide I do not need,
If you are swollen brook, come down with speed!
Has not my takbir broke your charm?
Revoke, if show of courage does not harm!
A dervish holds the reins of time like steed,
He brings sun, stars and moon to book with speed!
The thoughts of young both masked and plain
From qalandarʹs eyes canʹt hid remain.
I know your states for I too crost,
These tracts in times which now are past.
The wise ʹbout words do not quarrel,
He heeds not shell who seeks the pearl.
Men crazed with love of God possess,
Wit that from spark the flame can guess.
An import complex confirmed by heart,
Is precious more than gems in mart.
As good as dead is science and art,
Which took not birth from bleeding heart!
That man alone is brave and free, Whose stroke is full of main and might;
That man is coward through and through, Who leans on guile and tricks in fight.
From creationʹs Immemorial Dawn, Free born men own a bent of mind,
Qalandarʹs traits donning cloak and crown, Such distinctive marks in them we find.
The spark lies hid within their clay, Which the world to itself takes;
Transforms it as if by a smell, And world—illuming sun it makes.
This life is free from ugly taint, That makes men round the fane to tread:
O God! the faithful and pagan all, Have worn on shoulders sacred thread.
Thus Khizr to me did speak, Last day on river banks.
ʺAre you in search of cure, For venom spread by Franksʺ?
I know a subtle point, Which like the sword is keen:
Is cutting, burnished, bright, And owns a peculiar sheen.
A heathen gets distinct, By getting lost in life
Whereas a Muslim true, Keeps ’bove its brawl and strife.
The sedent nations of the East, Or active dwellers of the West;
Are inmates of such dungeons that, Were built by them with zeal and zest!
The priests who guide the Christian church, And elders who maintain the Shrine,
Lack newness of discourse and speech, Bereft are they of actions fine.
Experts in statecraft practise still, The same antique guile and wily tricks
No flights of fancy the bard can claim, To ideals low and mean he sticks!
It is time that the expected Guide, May soon appear on worldly stage;
His piercing glance in realm of thought, Would cause a violent storm to rage.
IN THE WORLD
A man whose faith is firm and strong, Is soft as silk in friendly throng:
In skirmish between wrong and right, Like sword of steel, he stands to fight!
The skies are his inveterate foes, His war with them e’er onward goes:
Though Muslim true of clay is born, From earthly bonds still he is torn.
To hunt the sparrow and the dove, He does not like and does not love:
He much aspires his noose to cast, On angels great and hold it fast.
IN PARADISE
The angels of this thing are sure, That a Muslim can allure;
But Maids of Eden do complain, From society he does oft refrain.
Before assembled Muslim priests,, Bab made a speech with apt remarks;
That fellow could not read aright, ʹSamawatsʹ with its syntactic marks.
The scholars smiled with contempt, At stupid error that he made.
He said with courage and aplomb, They knew not his spiritual grade:
The verses of the Holy Book, By desinential marks were bound;
They were ransomed and set free, For sake of guidance true and sound.
SATAN
Oh God, Creator! I did not hate your Adam,
That captive of Far‐and‐Near and Swift‐and‐Slow;
And what presumption could refuse to You Obedience?
If I would not kneel to him, The cause was Your own fore‐ordaining will.
GOD
SATAN
When did that mystery dawn on you? Before, Or after your sedition?
After, oh brightness! Whence all the glory of all being flows.
GOD (TO HIS ANGELS)
See what a groveling nature taught him this
Fine theorem! His not kneeling, he pretends, Belonged to My fore‐ordinance;
gives his freedom Necessity’s base title;—
wretch! His own Consuming fire he calls a wreath of smoke.
The bonds that in past, like bundle knit, The Faithful Fold, have now been split!
O God sent Guide, let Muslims know, What to do and where to go?
The Arabian Sea is quite bereft, Of stir, there rise no waves and crest;
The tempest that in me is hid, Has no place to spread and skid!
Caravan has left the tramp alone, But mount or food he does not own:
Where can the singing cameleer go, Who rides on hill and waste to and fro!
O Soul, whom God for message chose! This secret hid to me disclose:
Some light on this problem throw, Where may the guard of Godʹs portents go?
What, shall I tell you then, is a Muslim’s life?
Ecstasy’s summit joined with profoundest thought!
Even its setting flames like a rising sun;
Single its hue, yet manifold age by age;
Neither with those times sharing their scorn of virtue.
Nor with times past their bondage to myth and magic,
Firm on eternal verity’s bedrock standing—
Here is true life, no airy conceit of Plato!
Love, that the Spirit harbors, of loveliness Mingles amid its elements
With Iran’s Beauty of mind, Arabia’s inward fire.
What Guidance signifies you wish to know,
Insight, like me, may God on you bestow!
He is true guide and teacher of your age,
Who can with present fill your mind with rage.
By showing the face of Friend in looking glass,
May make your life more onerous and crass.
He may make your blood seethe with sense of harm
And on faqr’s whetstone may to sword transform.
Such guidance means revolt ’against Lustrous Creed
That makes the Muslims bow to kingly breed.
Perhaps your faith is so much quaint and queer,
For faqr and monkery same to you appear.
Faqr has a loathing great for monkish ease;
Its boat is ever tossed by stormy seas.
He yearns to put to test his frame and soul,
Display of self is his main aim and goal.
Its life like touchstone acts for Cosmos vast:
It knows what will perish and what will last.
Ask it if things on which your eyes are bent,
Are real or merely riot of hue and scent!
Since Muslim true of faqr has been bereft,
No Solomonʹs Faith or Solomonʹs awe are left.
A restless aching heart that throbs with Love, Is my lifeʹs only stock and hoard.
Your joys of life consist of wealth and gold, That worldly Science and Arts to you afford.
The marvel wrought by thinkers wise and sage, Consists of problems stiff that thought provoke:
Mount Sinai, Pharoahʹs rout and Mosesʹ Staff, Are miracles worked by those who God invoke.
I have conferred a Muslimʹs name on you, For sake of courtesy, custom and routine:
Though your breath is quite bereft of heat, Of Reckoning Day that shall emit blazing sheen.
My vest is torn to shreds and pieces since long, And this is due to my mindʹs frenzy great:
Your mind is still intact and sound, Wherefore impute the blame to me and slate?
You ought to keep your words within control, If you seek the bounteous glance of guide:
When you talk with those who insight own, Be courteous much, by conduct nice abide.
That nation cannot come to shame at all, Nor shall eʹer come across or face disgrace,
Whose youth are blessed with pluck and courage great, And guard with zeal the prestige of their race.
The twigs and boughs this subtle point explain
That sense of surrounding wide to plants is plain.
The seed is not content with dwelling dark,
It has a craze to spire from earth like spark.
Donʹt bar the path to deeds for Natureʹs claims,
Submission to Will of God has different aims.
If there is pluck for growth, the suburbs suffice;
O man, the world is wide, if you are wise.
The subtle point in Godʹs Oneness hid, With ease in words we can explain;
But what about your mind unsound, That brims with myths and idols vain?
The Elder of the Shrine has traits, That smack of juristʹs faith and creed:
Much thirst for view ‘No god but He,’ Among his fellows cannot breed.
None can appraise the glee one gets, When war is on ’twixt good and bad:
He who canʹt inflict deadly blows, And strokes in war is never glad.
Observations made by free born men, In world with marvels so replete;
To those who own the glance of thralls, None can such wonders ʹfore them repeat.
A dervish holds a loftier rank, Than a monarch who wears a crown;
There is no cure for such a man, Who, like paupers, has sunk down.
With zeal and fervour man is fired:
By looks of man by God inspired!
The intense heat his breath imparts,
A blaze in park and orchard starts!
The mode of hawks the thrush displays,
The birds that chirp change mode and ways!
Such man rapt with Godʹs Love can raise,
Low‐born to rank of Jam and Parwiz!
God save from revelations of a thrall,
Like Genghis, he leads to nations’ fall!
Since times antique the mind of man, In complex problems is involved:
What is the source of clay‐born man, And how the soul has been evolved?
Pain, anguish, glee and rapture sweet, Are spiritual states that man must face:
What is of much worth, cup or wine, Is knotty point you wish to trace?
What binds the words and their import, What links the body and the soul?
It wears the cloak of its own ash, Just like the burnt refuse of coal.
For Muslim true, death has no dread
To realm of souls, he straight is led.
Donʹt ask the rulers of this land, To grant blood price for martyred band.
Their blood is precious and divine, Like precincts of the Holy Shrine.
Alas! the Muslim has forgot, The lesson that to him was taught.
He was ordained to cry to none, Save to God Unique and One.
A gnostic, revivalist, jurist or Expert in Prophetʹs maxims I do not claim:
As such a prophetʹs rank and state, In terms precise I canʹt proclaim.
Despite these things I always keep, On Muslim lands my watchful eye:
To me are known the secrets hid, In depths of this azure sky.
In present age, so full of dusk, I have beheld this fact so stark
That peeps like bright and full grown moon, From sky that wears the mantle dark.
The seer, inspired by God, who fails, To prompt to deeds of might and main,
Is just akin to leaf of hemp, That makes oblivious to loss or gain.
The talisman wrought from mud and clay, Whom we give the name of man,
Is mystery known to God alone, Its essence true we can not scan.
Since Creationʹs Early Morn began, Time is engaged in constant flight,
Has tried to leave its trace on man, But has not met success e’en slight.
If you do not get much disturbed, To you this truth I may unroll
That man, Godʹs image, on the earth, Is neither frame of clay nor soul.
Contemporary era witnessed tremendous contacts among the nations;
The unity of mankind, however, remained concealed.
Western polity advocates division among the nations;
Islam pleads but for unification of humanity.
Holy Makkah has sent a message to Geneva:
Ought there be unity of mankind or unity among the nations?
O Shaykh, who tend the Holy Shrine, Discard these monkish modes of thine:
Grasp what morning songs denote, What aim or end I would promote.
May God preserve the youth you guide, And may they all by Faith abide!
Restraint and order you must teach, To shun conceit you ought to preach.
Those who blow on glass in West, Have taught the youth repose and rest:
Let them imbibe to bear the shocks, And cut the stones and hew the rocks.
The foreign Yoke that ran for periods long, Has drained the blood of heart, so strong;
Think of some cure, panacea or aught, To bring to end their sight distraught.
In fits of frenzy strong and great, Of mysteries, God I start to prate:
Bestow on my distracted brain, Some recompense for this pain.
A nationʹs life gets much prolonged, By lofty aims and ideals high:
If dwellers here some zeal possess, They can explore the heights of sky.
The Frankish Sage by guile and skill, New lease of life to nation gave:
The path for birth of Superman, By valour great he strove to pave.
To Guideʹs concept you seem averse, Too fed up with this thought appear:
This view for Muslims has the weight, That for Cathay has musk of deer.
If man alive puts on the shroud, Must we take that ass for dead:
Or tear to pieces small and shreds, His shroud and cast away the threads?
A Muslim true gets grandeur new, With momentʹs change and every hour:
By words and deeds he gives a proof, Of Mighty God, His reach and power.
To rout the foes, to grant them reprieve, Do pious deeds and show great might:
Are four ingredients that make, A Muslim Devout who shuns not fight.
With Gabriel trusted and steadfast, This clay‐born man has kinship close:
A dwelling in some land or clime, For himself Muslim never chose.
This secret yet none has grasped, That Muslim Scripture reads so sweet:
Practising rules by it prescribed, Becomes its pattern quite complete.
The Faithful acts on aims and ends, That Nature keeps before its sight:
In world he sifts the good and bad, In future shall judge wrong and right.
While dealing with friends and mates, He is dew that thirst of tulip slakes:
When engaged with his foes in fight, Like torrent strong makes rivers shake.
The charm of Natureʹs eternal song, In Muslimʹs life, no doubt is found:
Like chapter Rahman of the Quran, Is full of sweet melodious sound.
Such thoughts that shine like lustrous stars, My brain, like workshop, can provide:
You can select the star you like, So that your Fate this star may guide!
A newborn faith invokes his taste,
Adopts with zeal but leaves with haste.
In search for truth he takes no part,
As disciple stakes both head and heart.
If comments’ snare some hunter set,
From nest on bough would drop in net.
The right of thinking free, a Muslim owns,
Is gift or God which canʹt be checked by frowns.
He can transform the Shrine to Magian fane,
Can deck the Shrine with Frankish idols vain.
Can make the Holy Book the sport of boys,
And can with ease devise new faiths like toys.
In India queer and odd the farce you see,
The Faith is captive, but the Muslims free.
Through all the Western politeia, Religion withers to the roots;
For the white man, ties of blood and race, Are all he knows of brotherhood—
A Brahmin, in Britannia’s sight, Ascends no higher in life’s scale
Because the creed of the Messiah, Has numbered him with its recruits;
All Britain one day might embrace Muhammad’s doctrine, if she would,
And yet the Mohammedan, luckless wight, Be left as now beyond the pale.
It could have never borne fruit and foliage in the space lit up with light,
If from the dark recesses the seed had not moved on:
In life we begin with no and end with yes;
When no is divorced from yes it becomes destructive.
A nation which does not pass from no to yes
Is undoubtedly on the brink of death.
If Amirs of Arabian lands, Donʹt take it for a slur or slight:
This Muslim from the land of Ind, May speak with vigour great and might.
Who were the people whom at first, Godʹs apostle preached kinship close?
Division amongst them was infused, By men like Bu Lahab and such foes.
Their existence does not rest at all: On borders long and deserts vast
Arabian lands subsist because Of blessings of Arabiaʹs Prophet Last.
This problem is not hard to solve, O man, endowed with insight great:
Whʹr to obey dictates of God, Or submit to decrees of Fate.
The Wheel of Fate spins hundred times, Within the twinkling of the eye;
He, who follows freaks of Fate, Anon is down and anon is high.
Herbs, vegetables and minerals alike, Adhere to what Fate pre‐ordains:
But Muslim true obeys laws of God, All else abhors and much disdains.
If self of man perfection gains, Devoid of rest his heart remains:
Even in the niche of grave, Presence and Absence he must brave.
The Moon and stars shine like a spark, For moments few and then the dark:
The rapture caused by egoʹs wine, Is as eternal as things divine.
If your ego is ripe and mature, Your life from Death becomes secure:
Deathʹs angel may earthly frame contact, But can not harm your soul, in fact.
Though change so great has swept the world, There is no need to grieve or smart:
The same the earth and same the skies, By Grace of God, rise! Play your part!
The same hot blood runs in your veins, That raised the cry ʺThe self is Trueʺ
By Grace of God, rise! Play your part! And go in quest of ventures new.
Donʹt mourn or weep for scattered brain, It is a spell that Franks have cast:
This charm with case you can remove, Act, act, anew and leave the past!
SPINOZA
On life is fixed the gaze of persons bright,
What is life? Presence, being, joy and light!
PLATO
A wise man knows that ʹfore death he must bow,
In pitch dark night, life, like spark, soon loses glow.
Both life and death deserve not any heed,
The self of man is ego’s goal and need.
Love fled, Mind stung him like a snake; he could not
Force it to vision’s will.
He tracked the orbits of the stars, yet could not
Travel his own thoughts’ world;
Entangled in the labyrinth of his science
Lost count of good and ill;
Took captive the sun’s rays, and yet no sunrise
On life’s thick night unfurled.
Reality grows blurred to eyes whose vision
Servility and parrot‐ways abridge.
Can Persia or Arabia suck new life
From Europe’s culture, itself at the grave’s edge?
He, who predicts the Fate of man, And keeps his gaze eʹer fixed on sky:
Such man is unaware of fact, That rank of self is very high.
Those who perceive this fact so clear, That dome of sky that spins around,
Has not the height as self of man., ʹBout world have formed an opinion sound.
They are aware of all those things, That charm and repel the human sight:
To them alone this fact is known, What blackens heart, what renders bright.
Your vinteners have despaired me much, Like Samri, they can cast a spell:
With empty bowls to East have come, What they would do is hard to tell.
No lighting new can ever flash, In lap of clouds that float in sky:
Of lightning old, their sleeves are void, How can they gain a status high?
The Western culture depraves both heart and vision,
Because the soul of that culture is no longer chaste.
With a corrupted soul one cannot expect
To have a clean conscience, high thinking and refined tastes.
A nation whose youth are endowed, With self as strong and hard as steel:
No need of piercing swords in war, Such people brave can ever feel.
The world of Pleiades and the Moon, By natural laws is chained and bound;
Whereas the world in which you dwell, Owns insight, will and mind much sound.
What do the quivering waves imply, Save enormous zeal and zest for quest?
What lies concealed in mother shell, Is gift of God Who knows it best.
The hawk is never tired of flight, Does not drop gasping on the ground:
If unwearied it remains on wings, From huntersʹ dread is safe and sound.
If you traverse the road of love, Donʹt yearn to seek repose or rest:
If Layla be your companion close, That litter shun with great contempt.
O streamlet, onward flow and get, Transformed to torrent strong and deep:
If bank is eʹer on you bestowed, Abstain, flow on with mighty sweep.
Donʹt lose your bearings in this world, Because with idols it is full:
The assemblage here can cast a spell, Disdain, or strings of heart shall pull.
Gabriel on Creationʹs Early Morn, A piece of useful counsel gave:
He bade me not accept a heart, Enchained by mind of man like slave.
Untruth conceals in various masks, But Truth and God are both unique:
There canʹt be pool ʹtwixt good and bad— This fact is known from times antique.
I donʹt belong to Faris or Hind, To Iraq or Hijaz donʹt trace my breed:
The self to me this much has taught, Spurn both the worlds and pay no heed
You are a heathen in my view, The same to you may seem my creed
To count the breath, your faith and goal, While melting breath my job and deed.
Your change, no doubt, is good and well, And so your change of Muslim creed:
This Faith is meant for men, like hawks, It suits not pheasantsʹ quivering breed.
Such passionate Love of God and craze, In wilds and wastes has not caught my sight,
Whose magic force and rapture great, The faults of reason may set right.
A poet must neʹer keep aloof, From noisy fretful stream of life
The bard, who shuns the facts and truths, Canʹt make the nation face its strife.
The Truth‐seeking man whose self has awakened
Is like a sword which is cutting and brilliant.
To his keen eye is visible
The power to show what is latent in every atom.
To him you cannot be compared:
You are the slave of the heavens while he is their master.
You have not yet developed even a desire for the shore;
He has grasped the secrets of the deep through the purity of his soul.
If self is bred with perfect care, Such force and strength it can acquire
That handful dust of man with ease, Can set untruths and wrongs afire.
This is the mystery we ascribe, To Moses in every age and clime:
He tended the sheep in wilds and learnt, From Shoaib to toil and mode sublime.
Free thinking can bring ʹbout the ruin, Of those whose thoughts are low and mean:
They donʹt possess the mode and style, Of though that may be chaste and clean.
If thoughts are raw and immature, No good accrues to man in least:
The utmost that such thoughts can do, Is change of wan to state of beast.
If the self is alive, even poverty is kingship:
The prestige of the penniless is not inferior to that of Sanjar and Tughral.
If the self is alive, the endless ocean is fordable;
To a live self the stones of a mountain are soft like silken cloth.
A live crocodile is free when encircled by water,
While a lifeless crocodile is enchained even by the wave in a mirage.
My talk makes Shaykh and Mullah show wrath undue,
Though disciples can put up with what is true.
That race is soon deprived of glorious deeds,
For talk on Being and Attributes hatred breeds.
This cosmos old is wrought in such a cast
That tavern, saki and flask donʹt for eʹer last.
That nation has the right to luck in life
Whose youth for honey take worldly blows and strife.
About the self here have no talk, O bard,
Because with schools such sermons donʹt accord.
Much good that birds that chirp may not descry,
The modes of hawk, its state and rank so high!
A free manʹs breath can match a subject year,
How slowly moves the time of serfs, is clear!
The free perform such deeds in span of breath,
But slaves are every instant prone to sudden death.
The thoughts of persons free with truth are lit,
But thoughts of slaves do not own sense a bit.
A slave has craze for marvels wrought by guides
Himself a wonder ʹlive, his memory fresh abides.
This is the training that befits them well,
Painting, music and science of plants as well.
Existence and knowledge both are poles apart,
Life burns the soul, whereas lore makes it smart.
Joy, wealth and power all, to lore are due,
How irksome that to self it yields no clue!
No dearth of lettered men, ah few! provide
The bowl with wine of gnosis like true guide.
The ways of teachers donʹt expand the heart,
Matchstick canʹt light to electric lamp impart.
Just like the stars that shine in azure sky,
Thoughts have short span of life and soon they die.
The realm of self has its ups and downs,
Even here, the Fair and Foul exchange their frowns.
If self has reached the height, its acts are fine,
Debased, its deeds as good one canʹt define.
Devoid the West of inner light, Her soul is struck with deadly blight
The loss of self has made the East, A leper, for germs befitting feast.
The Arabs have lost their former zeal, Their souls are shrunk, they can not feel;
Iraq and Persia are bereft, Of bones and veins and naught is left!
The self of Indians is extinct, By pinions cleft is made distinct
For they are pleased with prison life, To break the bars they wage no strife!
Demise of self has made divine, Who keeps a watch on Holy Shrine,
To sell the robes that pilgrims don, On sale proceeds he lives upon.
The minds of those who go to school, In thoughts quite fresh and new are clad:
Alas! there are such people few, Who draw a line ʹtwixt good and bad.
Perhaps some luminous thought may flash, Across the inmost part of heart
For such inspiring thoughts one must, Set some recess in heart apart.
Wherefrom a man can find, Ripe thoughts in present age?
The weather of this park, No ripeness can presage.
The seats of learning give, The mind of pupils scope:
But leave the thoughts of youth, Unlinked by thread or rope.
The love of God is dead, By unbelief ’mong Franks:
Through lack of link in thoughts, East shackles wears on shanks.
God bring you acquainted with some storm!
No billow in your sea break in foam,
And never from books can you be weaned
Which you declaim, not comprehend.
Thus mountain stream to pebble spake,
“This lowly state for height you take.
You are tread upon and suffer deal,
How nice! my need the rivers feel.
You never clashed against a wall,
Donʹt know, a stone or glass to call.ʺ
This age that’s with us is your angel of death,
Its bread and butter cares catch your soul’s breath.
Your heart recoils from shock of combat; life
Is death, that deadens in men the joy of strife.
Learning estranged you from such exaltation
As would not let man’s mind desert its station;
A falcon’s eyes were yours by Nature’s right,
Slavishness left them only a poor wren’s sight,
And the schools hid from them those mysteries
That yield to hill’s and deserts still assize.
The subtle point that God is one, The German sage could not perceive:
Clear sight and mind are both a must, So that this point one may conceive.
The flights of fancy, like a dart, Can hit the dome of azure sky:
He casts his noose on moon and sun, That seem so far above and high.
Although his natural bent of mind, From stains and blemish is quite free;
His soul this dormant fact betrays, He yearns for life replete with spree.
If you desire to breed such ruby which is red,
Donʹt beg light of sun that from course has fled.
The world is trapped by traditions old and hoar,
Preceptors helpless quite, can do no more.
Those who deserved to lead the modern age,
Have worn out brains and others hold the stage.
That man alone in life shall find, To aim and end a certain sign:
Whose eyes in pitch dark night can see, And like the eyes of panther shine.
The slaves can get repose and rest, In world confined by Time and Space;
But men of high and noble birth, Havenʹt leisure in worldly race.
The progress great that West has mad, Has bedazzled your eyes a deal:
May Prophet guard your precious sight, To vouch him God did Najm reveal!
These revels do not last for long, Like guests they stay for a breath or so;
The bowls of wine that glint like stars, Are soon deprived of gloss and glow.
The books have marred your taste and zest, To such a great and vast extent,
That breeze of morn has also failed, To give you clue of rose and scent!
I know the modes of those who guide the creed,
Though lacking truth, of vision boast indeed.
The teaching that the English have devised
ʹGainst faith and ties has great intrigue contrived.
That race is doomed to bondage and much pain,
Which justice for its ego canʹt attain.
The faults of one man Nature can reprieve,
But groups for crimes no pardon can receive.
(1)
The present age destroys the faith and creed,
Like pagans has a bent of mind indeed.
The threshold of a saint is higher far
Than court of worldly king or mighty Czar.
It is a period full of magic art,
With spell so strong all play their part.
The fount and source of life is parched and dry,
No more the wine of gnosis can supply.
The shrines are empty of such saintly folk,
Whose glance good manners taught with single stroke.
The house, your presence illumes like a lamp,
Has mystic trend in veins and bears its stamp.
If essence of Godʹs Oneness be in heart,
The lore of Franks can cause no harm or smart.
On rose twigs chirp, for long there do not rest,
In selfhood you must seek your home and nest.
A man is ocean that is vast and free,
Its every drop is like the boundless sea.
If peasant is not charmed with life of ease,
A seed can yield a thousand‐fold increase.
I donʹt sit like sluggards and indulge in play,
It is time for your craft and skillʹs display.
(2)
If heart with love of God is not replete,
The life of man remains quite incomplete.
If quarry is wise acute and bold,
It can not be trapped by hunters old.
The Fount of Life in wordly life is found,
Provided you have a thirst quite true and sound.
Your envy for Faith is mystic course indeed,
For growth of faqr a lot of zeal you need.
My darling son, I see no chance at all
That hawk will like to turn a pheasantʹs thrall.
There is no dearth of goods, called verse or rhyme,
There are hundreds of poets much sublime.
My reach and might in world is this alone
That ʹneath the roof I cry, complain and groan.
In speaking truth I am much bold and frank,
In eyes of men I hold a lofty rank.
A son can not acquire his sireʹs renown,
Unless His grace by Mighty Lord is shown.
Nizami, the poet great of Persian tongue,
Gave counsel wise to son who still was young:
“On occasions where your greatness must prevail
Your lineage there wonʹt be of much avail.ʺ
(3)
The days and nights a Muslimʹs toils enhance:
Both creed and rule are like a game of chance.
Men drunk with zeal for deeds nowhere are found,
The rest are fond of talk with idle sound.
If you have courage great and ample force,
Seek such faqr which in Hijaz has its source.
This brand of faqr such virtues great can grant
That make man, like God, free from every want.
His hawk‐like status can spread general death
Of sparrows, pigeons all in single breath.
The glance of mind by its means burns and blazes
Without collyrium begged from Avicenna and Rhazes.
If temper of Ayaz is free from every slavish trend,
Like Mahmud can win grandeur which hasnʹt end.
Your worldʹs Sarafil has neither taste nor zeal,
He canʹt blow trumpet nor can skill reveal.
Its glance a world‐wide tumult can inspire,
In obscure mode sets right the things entire.
A warrior who can this Jealous Faqr attain,
Without sword and lance great conquests he can gain.
It sets the faithful free from need and want,
Beg God that such faqr to you He may grant.
To solve this riddle thinkers have much tried,
Their efforts all so far it has defied.
No doubt, to womanʹs faith and conduct clear,
The Pleiades and moon do witness bear.
This vice in Frankish way of life we find,
Men fools and blind, canʹt read a womanʹs mind.
Ask the wise men of Europe, who have hung
Their ring in the nose of Greece and Hindostan:
Is this their civilization’s highest rung—
A childless woman and a jobless man?
Great change the lofty spheres have met,
O God! the world has not budged as yet.
In man and wife is no contrast,
They like seclusion and hold it fast.
The sons of Adam still wear the mask,
But self hasnʹt peeped out of the casque.
Much greed for show and fame, Has put this age to shame:
The glance is bright and clear, Heartʹs mirror, but is blear.
When zeal and zest for sight, exceed their greatest height,
Thoughts soar to highest point, And soon are out of joint.
That vernal drop of rain, The state of pearl canʹt gain
If destined not to dwell, In lap of mother shell.
Retreat is blessed state, ʹBout self gives knowledge great:
Alas! this state divine, Isnʹt found in fane or shrine.
The picture that this world presents, From woman gets its tints and scents:
She is the lyre that can impart, Pathos and warmth to human heart.
Her handful clay is superior far, To Pleiades that so higher are
For every man with knowledge vast, Like gem out of her cask is cast.
Like Plato can not hold discourse, Nor can with thunderous voice declaim:
But Plato was a spark that broke, From her fire that blazed like flame.
I know quite well that one despoils, While other is like candy sweet:
I can not give a verdict true, Which needs of Quest can fully meet.
I like to make no more remark, And earn the wrath of present age:
Already the sons of modern cult, ʹGainst me are full of ire and rage.
The insight owned by woman can, This subtle point with ease reveal:
Constrained and helpless, wise and sage, With knotty point they can not deal.
It is an uphill task to judge, What is more precious, lends much grace:
Emancipation for fair sex or aught, Or emerald‐wrought superb neck‐lace?
A fact alive is in my breast concealed,
He can behold whose blood is not congealed.
To wear a veil and learn new lore or old,
Canʹt guard fair sex except a person bold.
A nation which canʹt see this truth divine,
Pale grows its son and soon begins decline.
If Frankish culture blights the motherly urge,
For human race it means a funeral dirge.
The lore that makes a woman lose her rank
Is naught but death in eyes of wise and frank.
If schools for girls no lore impart on creed,
Then lore and crafts for Love are death indeed.
The spirit of man can display its self without obligation to another,
But the spirit of woman cannot fully reveal its self without another’s help.
Her desire is the secret of her fever of sorrow:
Her existence is full of fire with the wish to create.
Here is the fire which opens the secrets of life;
That is the heat which sustains the struggle between to be and not to be.
I too feel sad about the oppression of women,
But this knotty problem cannot be resolved.
Music, religion, politics, knowledge, art
Have all in their possession matchless pearls.
They emanate from the mind of a creature made of dust,
But higher than the stars is their abode.
If they protect the ego, they are life itself;
If they cannot, they are mere magic and false tales.
People have come to grief under the sky
Whenever their religion and their literature Have been divorced from egohood.
New worlds derive their pomp, From thoughts quite fresh and new
From stones and bricks a world, Was neither built nor grew.
The firm resolve of those, Who depths of self explore,
Transforms this stream to sea, That has no marge or shore.
The fellow same is lord, Of freaks of fate and strife,
Who with eʹery breath he draws, Creates an eternal life.
The death of self has made, The lands of East effete:
Men who Godʹs secrets share, In these realms are deplete.
The air of waste gives out, The smell of friendship deep
Perhaps there may be some, Who may my company keep.
Poets and priestly class denote and show, The shops of those who blow the glass.
What pity! the mad frequents the wilds and lanes, To smash these shops, this way he does not pass.
Few know that madness can with ease display, A myriad crafts, accomplishments and skill,
Provided one can completely wean it of, The wastes and deserts, from gorge and hill.
The concourse as well as the air of school, Accord with it and tickle its sense of joy:
As lonely site and haunt for him arenʹt must, At school he never feels cast down or coy.
I must complain of your self‐flaunting airs—
My secrets, when you go unveiled, lie bare.
Instead of floating like a truant spark,
Seek out the fastness of some glowing heart!
What should my eyes, but an architect’ Nimbleness,
see in this shrine Of the West?
It knows nothing of God, Mosque?—the Frankish illusionists
Have smuggled into the carcass Of a shrine, an idol‐hall’s soul!
And who built this palace of idols?
The same robbers whose hands have turned Damascus into a desert.
Now Love from mind must take the lead, By God bestowed on human race:
To dear oneʹs lane it must not go, And bring with haste on head disgrace.
Love must infuse new soul in old, Poetic moulds and change their course,
Or break the chains of antique soul, Set it free from mimetic force.
The Spring has come with tulips wild, They seem like carvans on the move:
The youth, their charm and ecstatic joy, Of colossal worth and value prove.
The sea that has no bound or marge, And azure sky that seems so high,
When pitch dark night has upper hand, They gleam and glint like stars in sky.
How nice the bride‐like moon appears, While touring sky in van of night!
At morn, the sun presents a scene, Much grand in sky so blue and bright.
One must have eyes to see these sights, Which vie with each in bloom and grace:
For Nature is not wont to sell, The charm appearing on her face.
Now naught remains in Muslimʹs breast, His heart devoid of glint and glow:
He avowed with zeal ʹNo God but He,ʹ But dead and cold the zeal for show.
The Muslimʹs state has so declined, That Nature fails to know at sight,
Because the slavish acts of Ayaz, Have put Mahmudʹs high rank in plight.
You have withstood the ruin of Time, And kept your ground as firm as rock.
Constraint has turned the Muslims weak, You put them all to shame and shock.
The worship of such Muslims suits, Your structure immense and so vast,
Who with one breath that God is Great, Find truth and lies away cast.
The Muslimʹs breast is quite bereft, Of previous heat and ardour strong:
His blessings, worship are devoid, Of innate heat and fret since long.
His call to prayer is devoid, Of lofty tones and grandeur great;
O God, let this be known to him, Will you let him ʹfore you prostrate?
Your beingʹs sanctum gets, From self its inner light:
Save zeal and firm resolve, Naught can make life eʹer bright.
Its rank is higher than, The Pleiades and the moon:
Your essence and its gifts, Are egoʹs greatest boon.
God save that alien self, Seek shelter in your shrine!
The creed of idols shun, Donʹt desecrate house divine.
Forgetfulness of self, Imports the height of art,
But with the loss of self, Both joy and warmth depart.
(1)
The sun conveyed this message to its rays
ʺWhat wonder great, the change of nights and days!
You have been rambling since aeons in space,
But hate among men is increasing pace.
To shine on sand affords no pleasure sound,
Nor peace, like breeze in making flowerʹs round.
Be lost in fount of light that gave you birth,
Forsake the park, the waste, the roof and earthʺ.
(2)
The rays rise from every nook of space,
Make haste to take the sun in fond embrace.
Loud roar persists, there canʹt be light in West,
For smoke makes West enrobed in able vest.
Though East is not bereft of inner light,
Yet quiet of tomb prevails like Celestial Height.
O sun that light the world keep us in mind,
Hide us in breast so bright and kind.
(3)
A shameless ray as proud as houriʹs glance
Bereft of rest, like mercury eʹer at dance,
Implored the sun to let it spread its light
Till every mote of East grows lustrous bright.
The dark surroundings of Hind it wonʹt forsal
Till natives sunk in slumber do not wake.
The hopes of Orient on this region hinge,
The tears that Iqbal sheds on it impinge.
The moon and Pleiades get light from this land,
Its stones are costlier than gems of purest brand.
It has produced men who hid sense can see,
With utmost ease can cross the swollen sea.
The harp whose music warmth to gathering lent
The plectrum alien is with force quite spent.
The Brahman guards the fane and sleeps at gate,
The Muslim in mosqueʹs niche bewails his fate.
Donʹt shun the East, nor look on West with scorn,
Since Nature yearns for change of night to morn.
With courage great a war I wage, ʹGainst evils of the present age:
I do not bear a fighterʹs name, To chieftainship I lay no claim.
I am not conscious ʹbout this fact, If it is verse or other tact:
God has bestowed on me since long, His praise, reflection, charm and song.
The flood of light that makes its show, On true and faithful Muslimʹs brow:
With grandeur same is quite replete, That fills beingʹs soul and makes complete.
You do not call it unbelief, No less it is than disbelief:
That truthful man may get content, I With today, for change show no intent.
Donʹt grieve, for millenniums and aeons more, Still lie ahead for man in store:
The ever spinning heaven blue, Is not devoid of planets new.
Contents of soul this world can not conceal,
For every mote has longing to reveal:
The course of life somewhat distinct appears,
If eager looks and sight become corn‐peers.
The members of a subject race, By dint of glance, its gloss and grace,
Have acquired the right and claim, To rule and get renown and fame.
The glance has might to cause defeat, It has the strength, its foes to beat:
We see through glance great charm and grace, It brings the lovers face to face.
Through self‐same glance my craze imparts, To motes and their most inner parts,
The wont and mode of wandering tramps, Who pay no heed to need of camps.
If fervent glance and vision keen, You have not met or ever seen;
Your being is a source of shame, On heart, and sight can bring a blame.
Sun, moon and Jupiter shine their hour;
Your self burns on, fed by Love’s power.
Your creed knows nothing of race or hue:
No credit in white or black, or blue!
Where selfhood droops, doubts fight ding‐dong;
Where it blooms—a world of verse and song!
If your soul rot under slavery’s blight,
Your art an idolater’s soulless rite;
If sense of your own greatness sway you,
Legions of men and Jinn obey you!
O fearless wave, at bed, Of river gems are found.
What are the gifts of coast? There dust and thorns abound.
The temper of lightning flash, That darts, my spark contains,
But still your bed of reeds, Is moist and sap retains.
The age in which you live, Is influenced by you:
To spheres that ever spin, It can no way be due.
I have come ʹcross in life, Men with such craze and pluck;
They could darn with much ease, The rents produced by Luck.
That man is toper fine, Who owes, no debt to wine:
Such men are very few, They raise no cry or hue.
The East has taverns still, Where you can find such wine,
Which makes perception dull, With grandeur gleam and shine.
Men with vision bright, For West have hope so slight:
The hearts of West arenʹt chaste, For actions good havenʹt taste.
O man, your stay and show beneath the sky, Is short and brief, like spark, that parts from flame:
Who can make man detect this fact so clear, That being of man enjoys high rank and name?
If craftsmanship of man is quite devoid, Of gift and tact the self to form and frame,
Alas! such art and music of the flute, Are naught but source of much disgrace and shame.
Schools and taverns can no morals teach, Save the fact that you do not exist:
Learn ʹto beʹ for you too are a fact, Besides, your ego thus shall long subsist.
Whence does the zest of liquor come, In mournful tune of hollow reed:
Is its main‐spring the playerʹs heart, Or does it from the pipe proceed?
What is the source of heartʹs great might, Wherefore to rapture it is prone:
How does it topple with a glance, The firm and mighty Achamenian throne?
Why does the heart bestow fresh life, On nations on verge of decline:
Why do its states have constant change, Are points that no one can divine?
Why is it that in eyes of man, On whom God has bestowed a heart,
The realms of Syria, Rome and Rayy, Are fake effects in the mart?
The day the minstrel grasps this point, Which is hid in depths of heart,
Take it for granted, you have traversed, All the stages required by art.
BREEZE
I could not find access to tracts, Where stars like pendent lamps do shine:
Tearing vest of tulips and the rose, Was main and foremost duty mine.
I feel an inner urge so great, To bid farewell to home and depart:
For joyful songs of nightingale, No zeal or zest to me impart.
O dew, Godʹs will has made you know, Full well, both park and heavens high:
What is more precious in your eyes, The dust of park or dome of sky?
DEW
If thorns and straws of worldly mead, To cause a tension in you fail,
Then bear in mind, this lonely park, For heavenʹs dome is like a veil.
The quiet environs of this waste, Whose intense heat scalds the heart:
In forming only dunes of sand, Nature has displayed its Art.
The grandeur of these pyramids, Puts lofty heavens to disgrace
What hand did build, design and frame, They seem attired in lasting grace?
Set your craftsmanship quite free, From Natureʹs chains that bind it tight
For men endowed with gift of craft, Arenʹt prey, of hunters need no fright.
The craftsmen by their tact have built, Such works that Eden jealous make:
The eyes endowed with sight can see, States hid that stir the heart and rake.
There is no self nor usual change, Of morn and night at all is found
The Muslims have got rid entire, Of combats and shun such a round.
Ali! the infidel poor still, Pays homage to his idols old
Though their broken state he knows, Yet on him they retain their hold.
You are a corpse and your art, The leader of your funeral rite
In pitch dark bed‐room of the grave, Of life the fellow catches sight.
In Eden Sinai to Rumi told, That people living in the East,
Still eat their bread and beans from begging cups, They have not made progress least.
Hallaj relates that thus at last, A man in India has appeared,
Who with efforts firm and strong, The webs that hid the self has cleared.
O people with observing eyes, A taste for observation is a good things, but
What good is observation if it does not see, The inwardness of things?
The aim of art should be to generate, A vital flame that never dies.
What use is a mere momentary spark?
What good, O rain‐drop, if you do not agitate The bosom of the sea,
And are content to be, A pearl lodged in a mother‐of‐pearl’s womb?
What good a breath of morning breeze, Whether as poet’s verse or singer’s air,
If it can only make the garden wilt?
O never without miracles do people rise;
What good is art that does not have, The impact of the rod of Moses?
FLOWER
Perhaps you fancied, My land is far off, sky‐herald!
No, it is not far.
DEW
But only laboring wings
Prove earth not far from heaven!
DAWN
Softly as morning, Enter this garden
Not trampling its dewdrop pearls,
Clasp hill and desert, yet still
Catch in your hands the sky’s robe.
Khaqani, the author of Tuhfatularaqain,
Is dear to those who truths can scan.
His wisdom is so sharp and keen,
From truths he can remove the screen.
With world of meanings he is free:
They dare not say ʺyou can not seeʺ.
Ask him what does this world imply,
Where does the cause or tumults lie?
He knows the world of requital well,
His maxims with much wisdom swell,
“Opinion ʹbout world you can derive,
Adam dead, Satan still alive!ʺ
Your half‐shut eyes still fail to see
What subtle fact this life may be.
Too meek to have a fondling will,
Devoid of qiam your worship still.
For songs of Rumi you havenʹt ears sharp,
Snapped the strings of your selfʹs harp.
If you behold the world with gaze much bright,
Of you the sky may beg morning light.
The sun may beg light from gleam of your spark
Your Luck may shine, from moonʹs brow, mark!
The sea may swell with lustrous waves of gems,
Put world to shame with art that from you stems.
You beg and borrow thoughts of othersʹ brains,
Find approach to self, donʹt take much pains!
Is it a fact or delusion mere, Which has been caused by erring eye:
Do earth, hills, deserts vast exist, And is there any azure sky?
Some aver that they do exist, Whereas some call their being untrue;
O God, it is very hard to find, To truth or falsehood certain clue.
Bedil resolved this tangled knot, With so much skill and manner nice,
Though sages and wise men of the past, To undo this skein had no device.
ʺIf heart of man were vast enough, This mead would have retained no trace
Some wine has overflowed the brim, Because the flask had narrow space.ʺ
With Hyderʹs might and brawn, I feel myself content
I wish you joy of wit, To you by Plato lent.
This is the charm and grace, In view of mine and sight
That heavens too prostrate, Before much main and might.
Without great majestic height, Grace is not of much use:
Song is mere puff of breath, If rapture canʹt produce.
I would not go to hell, Whose fire is dull and tame:
To suffer for my sins, I like a rearing flame.
The death of fancy is so widely spread
That men of Pers and Ind by Franks are led.
I feel sad that Behzads of modern time
Have lost Eastʹs rapture sweet and joy sublime.
O artist, of your talents I can tell,
You know the ancient crafts and new so well.
You have portrayed many a natural sight,
Display your self in Natureʹs mirror bright.
The bass and treble of minstrelʹs song, Much joy to human heart imparts:
What is the use of pleasure that, Is eʹer on wings and soon departs?
That melodious song is still unborn, And is concealed in heavenʹs breast,
Whose intense heat may transform, The solid stars to liquid form.
A song that may have such results, Which set men free from grief and pain,
And makes Ayaz break slavish And learn like kings to rule and reign.
Perplexing maze of moon and stars, May flop down, leave their course:
O God, you shall last and the cry, ʺGod is Great,ʺ uttered with much force.
The song that jurists of the self, Deem lawful in their mystic creed,
Has been expecting since a long, A bard, who can acquit indeed.
My remembrance lacks the warmth, And zeal that mystics oft attain:
My thought is not a scale at all, For deeds deserving need or pain.
I wish that jurist of the town, Who knows the rules that Prophet taught
And is adept at Book revealed, To my own point of view be brought.
If in the music or its strains, The message of decease is hid
Such music of harp, reed and lute, In view of mine is quite forbid.
To own the flow of brook, And meander on the earth
In gaze of mine hasnʹt charm, And canʹt endow with mirth.
O dear young man, divert, A bit aside your eye:
The water of the fount, By innate force surges high.
In lands of East, the bed of reeds, For pipe, the breath of minstrel needs;
O poet, let me this much know, ʺIf you have breath in breast, or no?
If nationʹs self grows too much weak, By chains of bondage and much meek,
It need not hear the Persian strains, For these will only add to pains.
If flask of glass shines like the day, Or is a pitcher made from clay:
Like sharpness of a sword of steel, To palate must its relish feel.
There is no land or home on earth, Beneath this spinning azure dome,
Where one without great stress and strain, The thrones of Jam and Kai may gain.
On Loveʹs way numerous Mounts Sinai appear, God manifests Himself so clear,
May stage of Love for ever last, And may not come to end too fast!
The Persian Muse is mirthsome and heart‐easing,
No whetstone for the sword‐edge of the self.
Better the song‐bird of the dawn be still,
Than by her notes lull flowerland into languor.
What use the patient axe that hews through mountains
Yet leaves Parvez and his proud throne unscathed?
This is an age, Iqbal, for craving flint:
From all glass‐wares they show you, turn away.
Their opinions bury love and enthusiasm,
In their dark ideas is the tomb of nations.
In their temples they carve symbols of death,
The art of such Brahmins is disgusted with life.
They conceal high goals from view;
They put the spirit to slumber and awaken the body.
The senses of the poor Indian poets, painters
And literary writers are obsessed by woman.
His contempt has no bound, His Loveʹs depth none can sound:
His wrath on men of God, Is tempered in manner odd.
Nurtured in mimicryʹs gloom, To tread like sheep his doom;
But he is much inclined, To creative bent of mind.
In midst of surging throng, He keeps aloof for long:
Like lamp, he lights the hall, But has not mate at all.
Faqr can like sun of morn, With light the mead adorn:
Its speech is frank and free, Though meanings tenuous be.
Its views vary with the rest, It deems them right and best;
Its innate slates unknown, To mystics with renown.
Decrees of Fate are not concealed, From man whose heart throbbing seems:
He sees the image of new World, In slumberous state, during dreams.
When prayer call at early morn, Transports him to Morpheusʹ domain,
He tries to build the world beheld, With utmost might and utmost main.
The body of the dreamt of world, Is made from his handful clay:
ʹʹGod is Great!ʺ his slogan shrill that can, The role of soul for new world play.
It is a gift by God bestowed, To coin fresh words with meanings new;
Yet skilful artist must work hard, As inborn trend is owned by few.
It is the heat in masonʹs blood, Who builds structures of various forms:
It may be Behzadʹs picture hall, Or house of wine where Hafiz charms.
Without resort to incessant strife, No skill or art completion gains:
If Farhad does not hew the rocks, No sparks flash, dark his house remains!
A song that fails to make your face, Glimmer and glow with joy and glee,
Shows that minstrelʹs blood is cold, His heart of heat and warmth is free.
That player on the flute who has, A conscience much defiled, impure,
With puff of breath can make a tune, Replete with poison which hasnʹt cure.
I have visited the meads in East, And West, where tulips parks adorn;
But I have not beheld a park, Where tulips have their collars torn.
How lofty was that Chinese’s self, Who for crime was condemned to death.
On eve of his beheading, he asked headsman, ʺStop for a span of breath!ʺ
He asked for stoppage many times, For it was very pleasant scene:
He wished to see for moments few, The swordʹs great‐glimmer, glow and sheen.
I do not know the mysteries of poetry.
This point, however, is clear from the nation’s history.
That poetry which is a message of eternal life
Is Gabriel’s song or Israfil’s trumpet‐call.
The souls of Satan and Gabriel too, From verse derive effulgence strong,
For dance and music both provide, Pathos and rapture for the throng.
A Chinese sage has thus disclosed, The secrets implied in this art:
ʺAs if verse is musicʹs soul, And dance performs bodyʹs part.ʺ
It is the mode of worldly men, Against the world to whine and groan;
It does not suit a dervish true, By Fate‐inflicted wounds to moan.
The wise old man explained to me, This subtle point in closet alone:
That control on self daring shows, Whereas plaints breed more guile and groan.
To Europe leave the dance of serpent limb:
The prophet’s power is born of the spirit’s dance.
That breeds the craving flesh, the sweating palm,
This breed the race of pilgrim and prince.
From wont and ways of nations all, These facts so clear with ease I learn,
The Russians seem to be in haste, To gain the goal for which they yearn.
The world is red tip with the modes, That arenʹt in vogue and are outworn;
My intellect, that was tame and mild, Much pert and insolent has grown.
These mysteries which the greed of man, Had kept in veils of stuff so coarse
Are step by step emerging now, And coming forth by dint of force.
O Muslim, dive deep in the Book, Which was revealed to Prophetsʹ Seal;
May God, by grace on you bestow, Politeness, for good deeds much zeal!
The fact concealed in words so far, ʺSpend what is surplus and is spare,ʺ
May come to light in modern age, And make the meanings clear and bare.
Your chessmatch of research and erudition—Your comedy of debate and disputation!—
The world has no more patience left to watch, This comedy of threadbare speculation.
What after all, sapient economists, Is to be found in your biblification?
A comedy of your nicely‐flowing curves, A sort of Barmecidal invitation.
In the idolatrous shrines of the Occident, Its pulpits and its seats of education,
Greed and its murderous crimes are masked under, Your knavish comedy of cerebration.
Death to man’s soul is Europe, death is Asia
To man’s will; neither feels the vital current.
In men’s hearts stir a revolution’s torrent;
Maybe our old world is nearing death.
The versed in this world’s business I am not,
There are shrewd folk who always know what’s what.
Swim with the tide, flatter Their Excellencies
Of the new dispensation that commences!
Would it be more vicarious, or—polite,
I wonder, to call an owl ‘the falcon of the night’?
One hermit’s eyes grew wet with watching how you fell,
Poor Muslim, under England’s spell.
God give you joy of those high offices, to taste
Whose sweets you laid your own soul waste!
But there’s a thing you cannot, try as you will, disguise
From any knowing pair of eyes:
No slave is given a partnership in England’s reign—
She only wants to buy her brain.
Unbridled luxury, State pomp and pride, Rich commerce;
but to dwell inside That lampless breast all tranquil thoughts refuse.
Dark is the white man’s country with the grime Of engines,
No valley that might see Splendour descending on a burning tree;
A civilization sick before its prime,
At its least gasp—leaving maybe, For caretakers of Christendom, the Jews.
There are poets, there are scholars, and there are sages—
A nation’s days of slavery are not uneventful!
But every one of them—poor creatures!—has a single goal,
Though each is unique in the ideas he expounds:
‘Better teach the lion to take flight like a deer,
So that the legend of the lion’s courage is forgotten!’
They seek to make the slaves feel at ease with their slavery,
Pretending to ‘expound and reason things out’.
Unsearchably God’s edicts move; who knows
What thoughts are stirring up deep in the world‐mind!
Those are appointed to pull down, who lately
Held it salvation to protect, the priests;
On godless Russia the command descends:
Smite all the Baals and Dagons of the Church!
No claim to the future, its joy or sorrow,
Has he in whose soul no hot passion burns now;
Unworthy the tumult and strife of tomorrow
That nation to whole will to‐day does not bow.
The poppy heard my song and tore her mantle;
The morning breeze is still in dearch of a garden.
Ill lodged in Ataturk or Reza Shah,
The soul of the East is still in search of a body.
This thing I am may merit chastisement;
Only—the world is still in search of a gibbet.
Thy rival, God! The Frankish statecraft is,
Though none but rich and great join in its worship.
One sole Archfiend didst Thou from flame make: it
Has formed from dust two hundred thousand fiends.
The present age is really the same old age:
It is either the men of prayer or the politicians who are in charge.
Neither the miracles of those men of prayer Nor the power of government is the reason for it
For centuries the people have been used to slavery.
There is no difficulty about being a master
When the people are entrenched deep in slavery.
The wisdom of the East and West
Has taught me something that will prove elixir to slaves:
Whether it is religion or philosophy, poverty or kingship –
All take firm beliefs as their base.
The words that a nation speaks are dead and its actions are futile
If its heart is bereft of firm beliefs.
None other than the Sphinx, the Dread One, lord
Of the secrets of old times, taught me this:
Strength That in one hour can swerve the fates of nations
Admits no puzzling intellect for rival,
Though many in each age are its manifestations—
Now Moses’ rod, and now Muhammad’s sword.
Those vultures of the West have yet to learn
What poisons lurk in Abyssinia’s corpse,
That rotting carcass ready to fall in pieces.
Civilization’s zenith, nadir of virtue;
In our world pillage is the nation’s trade,
Each wolf aprowl for inoffensive lambs.
Woe to the shining honour of the Church,
For Rome has shivered it in the market‐place!
Enmesh in politics the Brahmin—
from Their ancient altars the twice‐born expel!
The man who famine‐racked still fears no death—
Muhammad’s spirit from his breast expel!
With Frankish daydreams fill Arabia’s brain—
Islam from Yemen and Hijaz expel!
The Afghan reveres in religion: take this cure—
His teachers from their mountain‐glens expel!

Iqbal’s breath fans the poppy into flame—
Such minstrels from the flower‐garden expel!
Conquered the waters, Conquered the air—
Why should old heaven, Changed look not wear?
Europe’s imperialists Dreamed—but their dream
Soothsayers soon may, Read a new way!
Asia’s Geneva, Let Tehran be—
Earth’s book of fate new Statues may see.
A diver after pearls Nature made me,
Though wary of the abysses of the State.
Whomever its legerdemain may captivate,
She sets a term to every monarchy;
Farhad’s hill‐hewing labour still lives on,
Parvez’ conquering might is dead and gone.
A certain European revealed a secret,
Although the wise do not reveal the core of the matter.
Democracy is a certain form of government in which
Men are counted but not weighed.
This land of Syria gave the West a Prophet
Of purity and pity and innocence;
And Syria from the West as recompense
Gets dice and drink and troops of prostitutes.
What, are crimes like Mussolini’s so unheard of in this age?
Why should they put Europe’s goodies into such a silly rage?
Need the pot feel so indigent when the kettle wears a blot?
We are Culture’s twin utensils—I the kettle, you the pot.
You have watched my lust for conquest and dominion with a frown—
But have you not knocked the brittle walls of feeble countries down?
To whose empires is that clever piece of trickery so dear,
By which royal seats survive but kings and kingdoms disappear.
We, the children of the Caesars, strove to water heath and sand—
You could never bear to leave untaxed the earth’s most barren land!
You have plundered tents of nomads of the little wealth they own,
You have plundered peasants ploughlands, you have plundered crown and throne—
And that looting and that killing—in a civilized way—
Yesterday you, you defended! I defend it now to‐day.
What is poor India’s fate ‐who knows? ‐ for up till now
It has been a glittering jewel in some crown!
Its peasant is a corpse that some grave has disgorged –
The corpse’s tattered shroud is still inside the ground;
His soul and his body are in pawn:
Alas, neither the residence nor the resident survives!
It is you who became the willing slave of Europe:
My complaint is against you, it is not against Europe!
It is not hard to find in present age
The place which needs cultureʹs angelic sage.
Where dice and drink are both by law forbid,
And women keep their bodies fully hid.
Although my body has a deep restless heart,
Yet forbearsʹ wont no disgust can impart.
Although deprived of schoolʹs beneficial fount,
On Bedouin’s wit and courage we can count.
The wise ʹmong Franks this verdict declare,
Of culture Arab lands are fully bare.
No truth from me can hide at all its face,
God gave me heart awake and wise, through grace.
In my view statesmanship cut off from creed,
Is Satanʹs slave, has no qualms, but low breed.
By quitting Church, Europe has freedom gained:
This statesmanship is like a giant unchained.
When their eyes on some weak domain alight,
Their Priests as vanguard act to wage the fight.
Iqbal has no doubt of Europe’s humaneness:
She sheds tears for all peoples groaning beneath oppression;
Her reverend churchmen furnish her liberally
With wiring and bulbs for moral illumination.
And yet, my heart burns for Syria and Palestine,
And finds for this knotty puzzle no explanation—
Enlarged from the ‘savage grasp’ of the Turk, they pine,
Poor things, in the clutches now of ‘civilization.’
A Frankish Lord advised his son to seek
Such aim that is always pleasant, neʹer bleak.
If lionʹs temper is to lamb revealed,
It will entirely make its blood congealed.
Much good if regal point remains in heart:
In dominating men sword plays no part.
Pour the self in cultureʹs acid strong;
When it becomes soft, mould it as you long.
On this elixir’s efficacy you can count:
To heap of dust can change a mighty mount!
ALEXANDER
Is your retribution shackles or cold steel?
Your violence on high seas all sailors feel!
PIRATE
Alas! Alexander, you deem it void of blame,
Do men of same craft bear each other shame?
Your craft is blood‐shed and my craft the same,
We are both bandits, in diverse fields play the game!
She’s been at her last gasp, poor wretch, for days
May telling ill news not bring ill news to me!—
Yet though her fate seems sealed, the Church still prays
Her fate may be averted. Well, maybe
After all the Old Man of Europe’s drab will rally
A few days longer, with the devil for ally!
Heaven’s blessing on those brazen Frenchmen shine!
Aleppo’s rare glass brims with their red wine.
—If the Jew claims the soil of Palestine,
Why not the Arab Spain? Some new design
Must have inflamed our English potentates;
This is no story of oranges, honey or dates.
On political leaders what hopes can we fix?
They are wedded to dust, in the dust play their tricks,
Their gaze always fastened on maggots and flies,
A web like the spider’s their ladder to rise.
That caravan’s happy whose chief is endowed
With thoughts light as angels’, and temper as proud.
The causes that make the nations sick, Are quite obscure, too vague and fine:
Although some man may try his best, Yet cause in full he can’t define.
The chiefs and guides of slaves have sunk, So low that it seems so much odd:
If mode of lions is presented to them, They will see naught save guile and fraud.
If a Moses forms a secret league, With the Pharaoh of his time:
For his nation such like‐Moses, Is curse, committing dreadful crime.
‘Why do your priests,’ said to me after prayers, A Turkish hero of the faith,
‘Drag out Their genuflexions so?’
He little knew, That free‐born Muslim, that plain warrior,
What kind of thing slaves’ prayers are!
In this world, A thousand tasks lie ready for the free,
In whom the love of high deeds burns and forges The nations and their laws;
But that fire never Touches the bondman’s limbs,
whose nights and days Stand still under an interdict.
If our Prostrations are long‐drawn,
why should you wonder?
God teach His ministers in India
A way of worship that shall be to all His people an evangel of new life!
I know the fire that burns throughout your frame,
The lands of world still fear its scorching flame.
Your cure in Geneva or London you canʹt trace,
Wind‐pipe of Franks is gripped by Jewish race.
I know that subject nations freedom gain,
If they would nourish self, display its main.
Slavery, slavishness, the root of our Disease;
Of theirs, that Demon holds all power;
Heart‐malady or brain‐malady has oppressed
Man’s whole world, sparing neither East nor West.
This pity is the pitiless fowler’s mask;
All the fresh notes I sang—of no avail!
Now he drops withered flowers in our cage, as though
To reconcile his jailbirds to their jail.
How can I quit this mountain land, Where my sires are interred in rocks
My exile from this land so dear, Is full of anguish, pain and shocks?
From Eternal Dawn You are abode, Of kestrel, hawk and birds of prey:
There rose and tulip do not grow, Nor Warbles nightingale so gay.
Your paths that twist and turn on bills, Give Eden's pleasure to my sight
Your clay emits an ember smell, Your sparkling streams look bright in light.
The kingly hawk can hot become, A thrall to pheasant or a dove
How can a man destroy his soul, For his clay-born body's love?
O zealous Faqr, let me know what, Is your verdict and firm intent:
Would you prefer the British robe, Or your shirt, thread-bare, torn and rent?
The discord that prevails among, The nations is an eternal truth:
This old and tyrant whirling dome, For none of us has any ruth.
Dive into the abyss of Self, And do not yield before despair
The wounds that: world on you inflicts, Is secret means of their repair.
If this truth that God has no peer, Sinks down in inner part of heart
You shall excel in grandeur all, In world affairs shall play great part.
Your prayers can't avert, Decrees of Fate at all
Your Self can change, but none, Knows what else may befall.
If some tremendous change, If human Self e'er shines,
It gains perfection's height, Gets free of world's confines.
The wine and drunkard's cries, May ever live and last
The wont and way of Saqi, And gourd may change too fast.
You beg your God to grant, Your cherished end and goal,
I pray my God to change, Your wish entire and whole,
The Sun, the Moon and Sphere all go astray,
Are vagrants who still straggle on the way.
Alexander fell on world like thunder clap,
But death soon caught him in its deadly trap.
King Nadir plundered Delhi's hoarded wealth,
Whereas his Chiefs put him to sword by stealth.
The Afghans and their hills e'en now remain.
Sovereignty and kingdom are only God’s
Free heroes are Compelled by wont and need,
These change a lion bold to fox indeed.
When Faqr with Self gets free and frank,
Both you and I attain the regal rank.
That Darvesh can build up a nation's Fate
Who never tries to seek the royal gate.
In school the noise of games, debates, Great stir and animation prevail
This abundant joy e'ery moment breeds, New griefs and naught else can avail.
For men of free and noble birth, Such knowledge is a venom dread,
Which makes them earn some barley corn, To fill their bellies with its bread.
O fool, great wisdom and book lore, Have not much worth nor carry weight
To learn a Useful art one must, Put in much strife and struggle great.

If such a craftsman likes, with ease, By dint of skill and magic art,
Like dew, can make from mass of Sun, The rays of light proceed and dart.
In world, if man contrives a thing much sound,
The men of every period make his round.
Don't spoil your Self by blind pursuit.
Take care of precious gem that has no suit.
That nation is welcome to have new ways,
Which has no thought save revels night and days.
Assumption of new modes this fact betrays,
Pretext is sought to follow Frankish ways.
The Romans, Syrians, Hindus too, Have changed and made a great advance
O son of hills, discern your Sell', And sharpness of your Self enhance.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care
If weather is fine. water quite enough, And terrain fertile and plain,
But peasant does not water fields, He is odd and can nothing gain.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care
That river has no weight at all, Whose billows do not swell and rise
That tempest is too weak and low, Whose gales by fury don't surprise.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care.
A person, who stire up and down, His clay, to Self can find a clue:
Kings who possess vast, mighty states, Can be ransomed for peasant true.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care
Self-respect of unlettered men, Your ignorance has saved from harm
Though scholars and savants sell, Their Faith to keep their bellies warm.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self have much care
The crow says, "In your wings no charm I find."
The bat says, "You have no craft, are blind."
O hawk, these low-caste birds of vast expanse,
Of azure heaven's twists and turns haven't sense.
They can't know states and rank of hawk aright,
Whose soul grows sight entire at time of flight.
Love's bent of mind is not so mean, And low like that of vicious greed
How can the hopping fly compete, With regal hawk in flight or speed?
To bring about a change in laws, Of park with ease one can engage
And for the nightingale can make, The nest as irksome as the cage.
If some one is about to set, On journey that is hard and long,
He does not wait for herald's sound, Like waves that flow without ding dong.
Though college youth appears alive, Yet he is in the throes of death:
He has no thoughts to call his own, And lives on borrowed Frankish breath.
If you e'er keep before your sight, The nature of your inmost heart
A casual glance of Saintly Guide, With much ease can perform this part.
That youth is held in high esteem, By all the members of his tribe,
Whose prime of life is pure and chaste, Dread blows to him we can ascribe.
In days of war he can surpass, Tile ferocious lions of the wood
When peace prevails in every place, Like Tartar deer is fine and good.
There is no wonder, if his glow, May set the things around afire
To burn the bed of reeds one spark, Is 'nough that from the flame does spire.
God Mighty has endowed him with, A monarch's grandeur, pomp and show
His brand of Faqr has virtues such, That shone on Haider's valorous brow.
Do not look down upon the youth, If his head is devoid of gear:
This lad can claim close kinship with, Those kings who crowns on heads do wear.
The same lamp that illumed your yesternight,
Though gone out, once again may gel alight
A courageless man can 'gainst Time bewail,
Whereas the free Fate's stings, like honey hail.
That youth for noise of wars can not be fit,
Who hearing wail of birds at morn loses wit
I fear that you. have childish bent of heart,
Those selling sweets in West are full of art.
In maze of Latin script and sin, Your bearings, no doubt, you have lost
Belief that none has might save God, Is cure for weak that acts so fast.
A man who likes to hunt the facts, Must quit All hopes of West, is cleat
Its atmosphere is full of charm, But one can't find musk-yielding deer.
The self of man derives much strength, From tears he sheds at early morn
Much good that tulip, like the dart, The marge of some brook may adorn.
This idol-house of hue and scent, Or fane so ancient, old and hoar
Hunts those who don't believe in God, On Muslims has effect no more.
O Shaikh, get all the rich expelled, From precincts of the Holy mosque
For niche of mosque is angry with, Them all for their much impious task.
To me upset appears the Cosmos old,
But I do not know what your eyes behold.
In breasts the morn of Last Day comes to view.
Old thoughts of youth have been replaced by new.
Your hymns at morn can't make amends for Life,
O Elder of the shrine, without much strife.
The Shrines no strength to Self e'er can impart.
Because no sparks from wet flame can depart.
Without a toper's courage, Love, Consists of naught save trick and guile
A man, whose Love of God is great, Has brawny arms and is agile.
Alas the love of case and rest, Among the pilgrims seems profound
A man, who journey's toils may deem, As steed and food, is nowhere found.
O men of plains, do not think, That I teach the beastly mode and art
The lonely desert arid the mounts, The man Self knowledge can impart.
This world observes traditions old, In world to come mere hymns can serve
Forge both worlds and stick to God, If kingly grandeur you wish to deserve.
O pilgrim, who tread mystic path, Your goal with case you can attain
Man's Conscience can bear out this fact, That Faqr's high rank isn't hard to gain.
The steel can never make or forge, A sharp and sturdy sword at all
If steel is smooth and soft, like silk, Such toys, true sword one can not call.
If Faqr possesses no self esteem, It means God Mighty's ire and wrath
If respect for Self keeps in view, To riches great it paves the path.
The Franks have made you oblivious, To Self, otherwise O Believer True,
You are the bearer of happy news, And warn the sinners 'gainst their due.
The nations suffer death, From centre if they part
If they have centre strong, Godhead it can impart,
Such Faqr which has a plaint, Against the toils of life
Has beggar's wont and mode, And can't bear worldly strife.
A godly man even now, By wondrous act can chancre
To tiny mustard seed, A lofty mountain range.
In fight without your heat, No zeal or zest is found:
Where are you godly man, Take part in combat's round
O Sun, arise from East, And sail upon my view
Give all the mountain range, A crimson tinge and hue.
'Mong Muslim men, if one, On firm belief has hold
His glance can set afire, All, whether young or old.
Off and on men are born, In waste or mountain range,
Who by their dint of Faqr, Pot-sherd to bezel change.
You can build up your luck, If courage you can show:
For God has written naught, With His pen on your brow.
This azure vast expanse, That goes by name of sky
If one has Wings for flight, In fact, is not so high.

Sher Shah explained this point with so much grace,
Distinction of tribes leads to much disgrace.
The names of various tribes to them are dear,
The robe of Afghaniat don't like to wear.
Their Islam is to pieces and fragments torn,
Like pagans, girdles by them still are worn.
They worship and adore their idols old,
May God help them deaf blows much bold
That glance can not be termed as true, Which draws; a line 'twixt red and pale
That sight is true which does not like, The light of Sun or Moon to 'vail.
The aim and goal of Muslim true, Is far beyond the bounds of West
Take longer steps and walk space, As this site is not meant for rest.
The marts that sell the wine in West, Always keep their doors ajar:
The rapture caused by Knowledge new, Is removed from sin much afar.
If your frame is bereft or heat, Which words, "No god but He impart",
Then bear in mind this well-known fact, Your soul from body may depart.
The sons of Khans, who own high rank, Shall listen to my humble sound
Though I am dressed in rags and sack, And wear no cap or turban round.
One who resides in desert waste, Or person born on mountains steep
Can keep a watch on aims and ends, That Nature in its view does keep.
He draws no line 'twixt fair and foul, Of culture, whose spell makes you sleep
His Faqr possesses the wealth of kings, Who coffers full of God do as keep.
O warbler of this earthly mead, Why are your songs so sweet and fair
Wherefore, desert hawk, you own, Such grandeur great and daring rare?
O Shaikh, no doubt, the climate of your school, Is so much pure and chaste
But men, like Salman and Farooq, Are brought up in some desert waste.
The fire that Muslim Faith bestows, Is as sharp as the sword of steel,
But after thousand years is born, Its match, who mighty blows can deal.
IBLIS
This ancient game of elements, this base world!
The frustration of the longings of the great Empyrean’s dwellers.
Upon its destruction is bent to‐day that Fashioner of things,
Who gave it the name, “The world of Be it so.”
I inspired in the European the dream of Imperialism:
I broke the spell of the Mosque, the Temple and the Church.
I taught the destitute to believe in Destiny:
I infused into the wealthy the craze for Capitalism.
Who dare extinguish the blazing fire in him,
Whose tumults are stimulated by the inherent passion of Satan?
Who could summon the courage to bend down the old tree,
Whose branches their height to our watering owe?
FIRST COUNCILOR
Stable is the Satanic system, no doubt there is!
It has further strengthened in the commoners their slavishness indeed.
Since the dawn of Time have these helpless mortals been ordained to prostration:
Prayer devoid of the posture of standing erect is their nature’s constant urge.
In their heart no desire can in fact take its birth:
But if it does, perchance, it dies or is left unripe.
What wonders have our hard, persistent endeavours wrought!
To‐day finds the mystics and the priests all as subjects of Imperialism.
Suited to the disposition of the East was this opium indeed:
Otherwise Ilm‐i‐Kalam is no less self‐effacing than qawwali in effect.
What matters it, if the tumult of the pilgrimage and tawaf abides?
For, rendered blunt, lies unused the unsheathed sword of the Faithful.
Whose despair does this latest Ordinance prove:
“To the Muslim in this age is forbidden fighting in Lord’s name”?
SECOND COUNCILOR
Is the clamour for “Government by the people” evil or good?
Art thou unaware of the fresh mischiefs of the world?
FIRST COUNCILOR
Aware am I! but tells me my cosmic foresight:
No danger from what is but a masquerade for imperialism.
We ourselves have dressed imperialism in the garb of democracy
When man has grown to be a little self‐conscious and self‐observant.
The true nature of the system of imperialism lies elsewhere:
It depends not on the existence of an individual leader of a king.
Be it a national assembly of the court of Parviz,
Whoever casts a covetous eye on other’s harvest is a king.
Hast thou not observed the democratic system of the West?
With a brilliant exterior, its interior is darker than Genghis’s.
THIRD COUNCILOR
No cause for anxiety then, if the spirit of imperialism be preserved:
But what counter‐measure to the mischief wrought by that Jew have you?
That Moses without Light, that Jesus without the Cross:
No prophet is he, yet with him a book he carries.
I can hardly explain what significance does the infidel penetrating vision possess:
It is, methinks, the day of reckoning for the peoples of the East and the West.
No greater corruption of human nature than this would be:
Slaves have broken asunder the ropes of the masters’ tents.
FOURTH COUNCILOR
Watch its counteraction in the palaces of Imperial Rome:
Again did we inspire in the descendants of Caesar the dream of Caesar.
Who is coiled round the waves of the Mediterranean?
That now expands like a pine, and then wails like a rebeck!
THIRD COUNCILOR
Little do I recognize him to be a man of far‐sighted wisdom:
(A fool!) who has thus European politics exposed.
FIFTH COUNCILOR (TURNING TO IBLIS)
O thou! the fire of whose breath lends stability to the world‐process:
Whenever thou wished, everything hidden presently did thou reveal.
It is thy fire that has transformed dead earth and water into a world of beauty and endeavour:
Inspired by thy instruction, the fool of Paradise turns a seer.
More closely familiar with man’s nature than thee is not He:
Who among the simpletons is known as God the Sustainer.
Those whose business was confined to sanctifying, singing hymns and going round:
Thy sense of self‐respect has out them to shame for ever, with their heads hanging low.
Though the wizards of Europe all are disciples to thee:
No longer have I faith in their sagacity left.
That Jew, that mischief‐maker, that reincarnation of Mazdak:
Each tunic is about to be torn to shreds by his fanaticism.
Behold! the wild crow is vying with the falcon and the hyena:
Lo, how swiftly does the disposition of Time allow of a change!
It spread about, and covered the whole expanse of skies:
What we unwisely had taken for a handful of dust.
Such is the state of the ghastly dread of the morrow’s disturbance:
To‐day tremble with overwhelming awe, mountains, meadows and rivers all.
That world is going to turn topsy‐turvy, my Lord!
The world which resteth solely on thy governance.
IBLIS (TO HIS COUNCILORS)
Absolute command have I of the world of scent and hue!
The earth, the sun, the moon and the firmaments all!
With their own eyes shall the West and the East witness the Spectacle:
When I but warm the blood of the nations of Europe.
The leaders of politics and the patriarchs of church all:
One call from me would be enough to turn them mad.
The fool who considers it to be mere glass‐work:
Let him dare smash the goblets and ewers of this Civilization.
The collars torn asunder by the hand of Nature:
Can’t be darned with the needle of the Mazdakite logic.
How could I be frightened by these Socialists, straying about the streets?
Wretched and straitened, distracted in mind, incoherent in speech!
The only menace I anticipate may come that community:
Which still a spark of ambition hidden in its ashes retains.
Amongst this people there are still to be seen a few
Who go so far as to perform their ablutions with the tears of pre‐morning hours.
Knows he to whom are revealed the inner secrets of Time:
Not Mazdakism, but Islam is to be the trouble of the morrow.
2
I do know this community is no longer the bearer of the Quran:
The same Capitalism is the religion of the Believer now.
And I know, too, that in the dark night of the East
The sleeve of the holy ones of the Sanctuary is bereft of the white, illuminating hand.
The demands of the present age, however, spell the apprehension:
Lest the Shari‘ah of the Prophet should come to light one day:
Beware, a hundred times beware, of the Law of the Prophet!—
The protector of women’s honour, the tester of men’s capacities, the rearer of worthy men!
The message of death to any kind of slavery!
No sovereigns and no monarchs, no mendicants begging!
It does purify wealth of all pollution:
It makes the wealthy trustees of wealth and property.
What greater revolution in thought and action will there be:
Not to the crowned heads, but to God alone does this Earth belong!
Better, if this Law be kept hidden from the world’s eye:
So much the better, the Believer himself is deprived of inner conviction.
Better that he remains busy and entangled in the metaphysical theology:
Better, that he remains busy and entangled in the interpretations of the Book of God.
3
Whose cries of God is Most High could break the charm of the universe:
May the dark night of that God‐thinking man not ever turn bright!
Is the Son of Mary dead or is he endowed with eternal life?
Are the Attributes of God separate from God, or do they form what He is?
Does the expected mean Jesus of Nazareth?
Or a Renewer, endowed with the attributes of the Son of Mary?
Are the letters of the Word of God New or of Old?
In which of the doctrines does the salvation of the Blessed Community lies?
Are not enough to the Faithful in this age:
These idols of worship carved by Metaphysical Theology?

Our safety lies in that Believer remains a slave till Doomsday:
Renouncing this transitory world for others’ sake.
What is good in his case is that poetry and mysticism
Which may keep hidden from his eyes the game of Life.
Every moment do I dread the awakening of this community
Whose religion is, in reality, nothing short of taking account of the universe.
Keep him well absorbed in the thought and contemplation of God in pre‐morning hours:
Ye all make him grow stronger in his monastic disposition!
Winds of these wasteland be your love!
Bokhara, Delhi, are worth no more.
Like running water Go where you will:
these desert plains are ours, and Ours are these valleys.
Honour, that high thing in a world of troubling,
Sets on the hermit’s head Darius’ crown.
How Glass is forged flint‐hard—this strange craft they tell of
Learn from some master!
Fortunes of States through individual prowess ripen
Each man one star of their ascendant:
Ocean withholds her treasure when the diver
Groping for pearlshells Clings by land’s margin.
To the Muslim freedom Gained at the price of casting off religion
Makes an ill bargain!
In our world, where once more Civilization
Looses its wild beasts, in one more encounter Spirit and flesh meet;
on the true‐believer’s Manhood God’s trust lies—
the machines of Europe Satan’s alliance.
Who knows the nation’s fates?—
but signs abound, if Muslims are wakeful.
From your buried fathers Ask pride of action;
do not fear—a king may Smile on a beggar.
THE PORTRAIT
Said the portrait to its Painter:
“My manifestation attests to Thine unbounded Skill;
And yet what a violation of justice it is that
Thou shouldst remain hid from my sight!
THE PAINTER
The vision endowed to those that observe find it oppressive:
See for thyself how the spark burnt itself out when it saw the world!
What aught is sight but sadness, gloom, feverishness and self‐torment:
Rest, or thou ignorant (of the mysteries), upon report.
THE PORTRAIT
What aught is report but the impotence of ratiocination and wisdom?
Vision is the eternal springtide of life.
The hustle and the bustle of the present age does not permit one
To express oneself melodiously.
THE PAINTER
Thou doth exist because the Perfection of My Art.
Do not, then, feel cast out in disappointment with Him that hath drawn thee.
I only put one condition if thou wishest to see Me:
Never disappear from thine own sight.
THE CORPSE (TO ITS GRAVE)
What is it, this Resurrection Day? Of what present is it the future?
0 my ancient sleeping‐chamber, What is Resurrection Day?
THE GRAVE
O corpse of a hundred years, don’t you know
That every death implies a call for resurrection?
THE CORPSE
A death that implies resurrection
Such a death does not entrap me!
It is true that I have been dead for a hundred years,
But I am not tired of this dark chamber in the earth.
The soul should once again ride the poor body
If this is resurrection, then I am not a taker!
A VOICE FROM THE UNSEEN
Death is not for snakes and scorpions, Or for birds and beasts of prey,
Eternal death is the lot of slave nations alone.
Even Israfil’s trumpet cannot bring back to life those
Whose bodies, when they lived, had no souls.
To spring back to life after death ‐only the free can do that,
Even though all living beings are headed, Into the arms of the grave.
THE GRAVE (TO ITS CORPSE)
You vicious creature! In the world you were a slave!
I had failed to understand why my soil was as hot as fire!
NAAK
Your corpse makes my darkness even darker.
It rips the earth’s veil of honour.
Beware, beware a hundred times of a slave’s corpse!
O Israfil! O Lord of the universe! O soul that is chaste and pure!
THE VOICE FROM THE UNSEEN
Resurrection upsets the order of the universe,
But it is this commotions that reveals the secrets of existence.
An earthquake makes mountains fly like clouds,
But it also starts new springs flowing in the valleys.
Total destruction must come before any re‐creation –
For in this way the problems of existence are resolved.
THE EARTH
Oh, this eternal death! Oh, this struggle that marks life!
Will this conflict in the world ever end?
Reason cannot free itself from its idols;
The commoners and the elite‐all are slaves to Lat and Manat.
How abject Adam‐ the man with divine attributes ‐has now become!
That such a world should continue to exist, Is more than heart and eye can bear.
Good luck to that King, cashiered so gracefully, whose
Dismissal shows how a ruling Power behaves!
In Britain’s fane the King is only a plaster
Image its worshippers smash whenever they choose;
Its opiate incense is for us, the slaves—
Come, English swindler, bring out our new master!
Itching palms, in the old temple of Earth, have the kneelers,
Men who remember their God only when idols are deaf.
Vain are the Hindu’s rites and vain the Mohammedan’s worship;
Wailing and gnashing of teeth still are the lot of the poor.
None of earth’s cities in truth is more than a populous desert,
High though their buildings soar, kissing the sky with their roofs.
Axe in hand Farhad toils on;—Fate’s irony witness!
Slek and content is Parvez, parching with drought in Farhad.
All that there is in that world its rulers’ brains have engendered:
Science and learning are theirs, commerce and practice of State;
Free of enslavement, Allah be thanked, to the huckster of Europe—
Free is this country of ours, scorched in the furnace of Hell.
The sun, the moon, the stars, And this azure sky all around—
Who can tell for sure all this is, The world nothingness or being!
The ideas of roads and destinations, Are fictions and myths
As life is aimless journey, indeed
Alas! Time’s hand wiped out,
That monument of the perfections Of Ahmad and Mahmood.
His sudden death signifies, The decline of knowledge and art
His, Masood’s, who was The most valuable asset
Of this caravan of ours, The indifferent cold manner of Worldly men moves me to tears,
They reckon the dawn wails of birds As lilting songs!
Please! Do not plead that The remedy of grief for a friend, Lies hidden in patience!
Please do not say that in patience lies, The solution of Death’s riddle!
A heart, howsoever loving and patient, is All the same, a stone.
And between love and patience lie A thousand miles.
Saadi
Don’t ask what is fleeting life For, who knows what means
This combine of magic and colour charm?
One born of dust must hide in dust.
But what does it mean? A short lived absence or extinction?
This man, this mere dust of path, Has been endowed with artistic taste.
Of this, Reason cannot reveal the aim.
Are the heart and vision too, The miracles of this very water and clay?
If not, what then is the end‐all of man?
The moving soul of this universe is 'There is no god but God',
Then why the Messiah, the nails and the cross?
From whom should be demanded The blood‐money of longings spilt?
For, who is the guilty and what the blood money?
Grieve not that we are In the bondage of this world,
As the heart that we have, Breaks all magic spells.
If the self lives, death is but A sojourn in life:
as love Tries death in a test of eternal life.
If the self is alive, your ocean is shoreless
And the waves of the Nile, of Euphrates are restless, separated from you.
If the self is dead, you are like a straw before the breeze,
If the self is alive, you the sultan of all existence.
If the eye is deprived of One vision of beauty exposed,
Myriad exposures of beauty Compensate for one loss.
The station of a true momin is Beyond the sky’s reach.
Below, from the earth to the Pleiades, All are idol‐houses of Lat and Manat.
His eternal abode is The sacred precinct of the One and the Only One,
Not this gloomy dusty grave Nor this exposure house of Attributes!
Those self‐aware who have Leapt above this abode of dust
Have broken the spell of The sun, the sky and the stars!
From the Emperium enquires A voice at dawn:
how did You lose your essential quality Of enquiry and understanding?
How was blunted Your scalpel of research?
Why do you not rend open The hearts of stars?
You deserve to dominate and rule over All that is visible as well as esoteric.
Can a flame be the slave of Dry sticks and grass?
Why are the sun, moon and stars not Under your suzerainty?
Why don’t heavens shudder With a mere glance from you?
True! Even to‐day blood courses Through your veins,
but Your thoughts do not inspire, Nor is your thinking fearless.
An eye which in its vision, Does not imbibe pure virtue
Is capable of seeing, no doubt, But is not all‐seeing.
Not a bit remains in you Of your clear reflection of conscience!
Alas! O you victim of imperialism, Of mullah‐ism and mysticism!
What fruit will the bough of my hope bear–
What do I know of your destiny?
The rose‐bud needs to open today–
Why wait for tomorrow’s morning breeze?
Set him free of this world’s affairs
To be free of casting for everyone snares.
In old age, Satan’s thoughts too are old
Wherefrom should he bring new sins’ flares?
Upset this world of morn and eve,
Of these wetlands, of those dry leave.
May your Godhead remain free of blemish all
In my insipid prostrations do not believe!
My poor estate makes proud men covetous,
Poverty such as mine ennobles us.
Beware those other rags and begging‐bowls
That make the Muslim pusillanimous!
Rescue me please from wisdom’s narrowness
And from excessive light, its plentifulness.
It deigns to cast looks at others, that is,
The eye of Muslims’ shamelessness!
Iqbal said to the Shaykh of the Ka‘bah:
‘Who went to sleep under the very arch in the mosque?’
A voice sounded from the walls of the mosque:
‘Who became lost in the idol‐house of the West?’
The old flame of desires has grown cold,
As the Muslims’ veins hot‐blood no longer hold.
Greetings to the idols for my secularism,
For flame of Allah Hoo’s cheers is dead, behold!
The talk of Muslim is interesting, His heart warm,
breath light and gaze arresting.
O who can catch a glimpse of him, for he,
Though the very soul of company, is by himself resting!
The clairvoyance of the zephyr
Is apparent from its discrimination between flowers and thorns!
A flower cannot be guarded
If the thorn has the nature of silk.
Of love and losing what words need be said?
The self’s unfolding is Life’s fountain‐head;
There’s neither loss to ocean nor to pearl
In the pearl’s loosening from the ocean’s bed.
Why is there no storm in your sea?
Why is your khudi not Muslim?
It is pointless to complain of God’s decree –
Why are you not God’s decree?
If with the heart’s eye the intellect would see aright
This universe is illuminated with Allah’s light.
But if you see through the waxing sun and moon,
It is just the revolution of morn and night.
Sometimes by rising from the ocean like a wave,
Occasionally like a diver in its bosom behave.
At times cross beyond the ocean’s shore
To expose better your self’s real enclave.
Your springs and lakes with water pulsating and quivering like quicksilver,
the morning birds fluttering about the sky, agitated and in turmoil,
O Valley of Laulab!
When the pulpit and the niche cease to re‐create Resurrections,
faith then is dead or a mere dream, for thee, me and for all.
O Valley of Laulab!

O Valley of Laulab!
The Mullah’s sight has lost the light of penetrative discernment;
the mystic’s wine, pure and sparkling, no longer produces frenzy,
O Valley of Laulab!
A dervish whose morning lamentation
may awaken the hearts of the people is no longer around,
Harder than death is what thou call’st slavery,
would that slaves understand master’s tricks;
strange are the ways of imperialists:
they allow the sounding of trumpet; but forbid resurrection.
Thy soul is weary under the stress of slavery,
build niche for khudi in thy impassive breast.
Today that land of Kashmir, under the heels of the enemy, has become weak, helpless and poor—
once known among the wise as Little Iran.
When the man of truth is overawed by the power and pomp of king and landlord,
a cry of burning lament issues forth from the heavens.
The old farmer’s cottage, on the mountainside, where pain and grief ever rule—
tells its sad story of Fate’s hard lot.
So skilful of hands, so rich in mind, these people, alas, or pure breed,
O God, your justice, so long delayed, must come at last as a retribution.
When the enslaved people’s rage boils and they rise in revolt against the master,
this world of near and far, of colour and smell, becomes the scene of tremors and convulsions.
It purifies man’s conscience—eschewing all doubts and misgivings—
When the lamp of high ideals is lit, brightening all paths leading to the goal.
There are old maladies and ancients scars the people suffer from, that intellect fails to cure and heal,
but love shows its skill and without the help of physician’s talents removes all scars and cures all woes.
The master’s sturdy body—with a heart of stone and face of a mirror—
gets soon smashed up and beaten down at the repeated blows of the weak slave.
The partridge flies with the majesty of the falcons;
the hunter is nonplussed: is it a partridge or a falcon?
Every nation is astir, her thoughts in a constant flux;
today we see in the East the signs of tomorrow’s resurrection.
The deadbody, awaiting Israfil’s Call, has all of a sudden risen to life:
Nature’s pitiless laws work wonders.
The dissolute know the Sufi’s accomplishments,
though their miracles are not so well‐known.
Self‐enrichment, self‐respect and the cry of Ana‐al‐Haq—
these are the states of the wayfarer, if he be free;
but if slave, then it all becomes his all is He;
he is dead body, grave and sudden death, all in one.
Come out of the monastery and play the role of Shabbir,
for monastery’s faqr is but grief and affliction.
Thy religion and literature both smell of renunciation:
symbol of old age of dying nations.
Imperialism has myriads of Satans with eyes full of magic charms
that evoke among the prey an irresistible urge to be its victim.
How carelessly they passed by, with no ear to my lamentations,
The Kashmiri’s black eyes, so lacking in lustre and life, who made them so dead and mute?
Thou think’st it a mere drop of blood; well,
manʹs heart is but lofty ambitions.
The revolutions of moon and stars are not to its liking:
It makes its own nights and days.
The earth that enshrines in its bosom the fire of plane tree:
this exalted earth can never be dead and cold.
When flowers’ bookshop opened in the garden
Mullah’s bookish knowledge lost all value.
The spring breeze was exhilarating, poise‐breaking,
the old man of Indrab burst into ghazal‐singing.
The tulip, of fiery skirt, said:
it doth reveal the secrets of the soul.
Who calls sleep awhile in the grave as eternal death,
sows seeds of destruction in the earth.
Life is not a succession of days and nights,
nor is it intoxication and dreamy sleep;
life is to burn in one’s fire:
happy is the man who grasps this truth.
If thou snatch’st a spark from heart’s fire,
thou canst be a sun under the sky.
A free man’s vein is hard like stone’s,
a slave’s is tender like vine’s;
a slave’s heart is dead, frustrated and never sees the light of hope;
a free man’s heart is alive, full of zest and happiness.
A free man’s wealth, a shining heart and warm breath,
that of slave, only moist eyes.
The slave lacks sincerity and generosity
though he be adept in argumentation.
And never the twine shall be equal,
the one is slave to fate, the other, master of fate.
All high and low are unaware of khudi:
is it a mosque or tavern?
The head preacher has withheld this secret from us:
the Harem itself is the moth moving round Harem’s lamp.
Faith and kufr, only talisman of ignorance,
talking of Shaykh and Brahman is all myth;
O God, may the valley have a dervish
whose faqr works Moses‐like;
how long would they remain hidden from the world?
the unique gems that the Wooler Lake has in its depth.
The living nations of the world have won their laurels,
the world transformed through the dynamism of their acts;
the astrologer’s calendar of the future is false,
the old stars have fallen away.
The world’s heart is so fiery
that river waves shoot out stars.
The earth is experiencing tremors after tremors,
the warnings of Nature are but too clear.
Khidr, standing by the Wooler, is thinking:
When will the Himalayas’ springs burst forth?
It is the sign of living nations
their fate changes day and night;
their life is sincerity and generosity to perfection,
Nature too forgives their follies;
in manners qalandar‐like, in majesty as Iskander:
these people are like naked swords.
Beauty and majesty of a self‐conscious man flows from khudi:
it is the text, the rest are commentaries.
I don’t deny the splendour of the days of ‘Id,
but alas! only the takbirs of free men are acceptable to God.
What can the sage know my songs’ secret?
the words of man of madness are beyond reason’s ken.
How heretically do you play the game of life?
you adjust yourself to times, rather than to thine self.
I no longer see in the schools
heart of Junaid and insight of Ghazali and Razi.
Nature—the great lawgiver—decrees:
the ways of falcon are forbidden in the religion of sparrows.
The same heavenly law‐giver decreed for the male falcon:
fly about the skies, don’t deal with the earth.
I have not left speaking the naked truth,
though the people may speak ill of me before the kings.
We have neither Samarkand nor Bukhara to offer,
the dervish can only pray for the Shirazi Turk.
The ways of the West are calculating, the ways of the East are monkish;
there the times change from moment to moment, here the times see no change whatsoever.
Khidr, on the bank of the river, spoke to me thus in confidence:
all are the ways of sorcery, be the actor a king of dervish.
These people of the monasteries look upon me as their rival;
they fear lest my beautiful songs rent asunder the saint’s threshold stone.
This is the manifest symbol of the knowledge of the slave people:
What if the earth has limits! the whole expanse of Space is boundless.
I can’t see what it is: is it self‐deception of deception of God?
Having invented the excuse of fate, the Muslim has ceased to act meaningfully.
The rose twig made the hunter weep on seeing me caught in the net:
a charming sweet singer was he, his nest rested harmlessly on my branches.
O land of charming and sweet flowers what need is there to explain:
the burning red tulip, grief‐stricken and sad, best reflects our bloody heart.
The gods of Himalayas speak thus to thee, to me and to all:
Fate is a name we give to the retribution of what we do and act.
In the bitter winds of winter, the poor labourer works in a naked body,
though his skill provides shawls to the rich.
The world shall never be loyal to thee:
it is and has been ever in flux.
Self‐awareness has made the mujahid forget his body,
to whom bearing of coat‐of‐mail is forbidden.
Nourish that lofty will and burning heart,
get back your father’s arms if thou wish’st to have his sword.
I am quiet a stranger to the town, listen to my bewailings;
may thy breast entertain many a resurrection!
The grief‐laden songs of mine are valuable:
the unsatisfied heart is a wealth most uncommon.
I fear the world does not appreciate my labour,
it isn’t like Farhad’s:
The axe’s noise falling on the stone is something else,
Beware, it is voice of axe falling on the heart.
It was God’s command that the pomp of Parviz
Be given to the qalandar, for he has angelic attributes.
I was told: Take it and be an emperor;
Confer permanence on the ephemeral with your talent.
I would have much honoured this trust—
All bitterness tastes sweet to the mouth of a dervish.
However, the self‐respect of faqr could not accept it
When He said: this is the charity of my Godhead.
The Ajamites do not yet know, The fine points of our faith;
Otherwise, Husain Ahmad of Deoband! What is this foolhardiness?
A sermon‐song from the pulpit that, A nation by a homeland be!
From the real position, Of the Arabian Prophet, How sadly unaware is he!
Your self merge with Mustafa, For all faith embodies in him!
If you do not reach up to him, It is all Bu Lahab’s idolatry!
To know and see is so easy in the world.
Nothing may stay hidden for this universe is luminous.
The Nature’s veil is translucent if one is willing to see:
Far too visible are the angel’s faint smiles.
This world is an invitation for the human being to look,
For every secret is given an instinct to jump out of its closet.
It is the tears of human blood that the Almighty has used
For stirring up storms in His oceans.
What would the sky know whose abode is this earthy planet;
On whose nightly banquets do the stars stand in watch!
If I am the end of all, then what lies beyond?
Where lies the limit of my unending adventures?
