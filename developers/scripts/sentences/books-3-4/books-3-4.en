The morn that shifts so soon tomorrow new,
Whence it comes is only known to few:
The dark abode of being is shook by morn,
Which by Muslimʹs call to prayer is born.
The secret of the self is hid, In words ʺNo god but He alone.ʺ
The self is just a dull‐edged sword, ʺNo god but He,ʺ the grinding stone.
An Abraham by the age is sought, To break the idols of this Hall:
The avowal of Godʹs Oneness can, Make all these idols headlong fall.
A bargain you have struck for goods, Of life, a step, that smacks conceit,
All save the call ʺNo god but Heʺ, Is merely fraught with fraud and deceit.
The worldly wealth and riches too, Ties of blood and friends a dream
The idols wrought by doubts untrue, All save Godʹs Oneness empty seem.
The mind has worn the holy thread, Of Time and Space like pagans all
Though Time and Space both illusive, ʺNo god but Heʺ is true withal.
These melodious songs are not confined, To Time when rose and tulip bloom
Whatever the season of year be, ʺNo god but Heʺ must ring till doom.
Many idols are still concealed, In their sleeves by the Faithful Fold,
I am ordained by Mighty God, To raise the call and be much bold.
The Quranic teaching that did bring, The Moon and Pleiades within human
Is now explained in manner strange, ’Twixt man and world to cause a breach.
Their mode of work has changed entire, Before the freaks of Fate they bow:
They had a say in what God decreed, But Muslims have now fallen low.
What was so evil has by steps, Put on the shape of good and fine:
In state of bondage, as is known, The shift of conscience is quite sure.
A mote endowed with strong desire for flight
Can reach the Sun and Moon with effort slight.
If chest of partridge fire and zeal emit,
My friends, in fight with hawk it can acquit.
Ascension means to gauge a Muslimʹs heart,
The Pleiades are the target of his dart.
No wonder, meanings of Najm from you hide,
On Moon depends your oceanʹs ebb and tide.
If your self had not been debased and lost,
Bergson, his spell on you would not have cast.
Hegelʹs shell is quite devoid of gem that gleams,
His talisman merely web of fancy seems.
Manʹs need is how this earthly life to brace,
He yearns that self may last ʹyond Time and Space.
To have a life steadfast is his desire,
He seeks some rules to guide his life entire.
The source, that gloom dispels, spreads light around,
Is worship call at morn with clarion sound.
I am by breed a pure and trite Somnati,
Ancestors mine were both Lati and Manati.
You hail from Hashemite Prophetʹs race,
My origin from Brahmans I have to trace.
Philosophy is my bodyʹs essential part,
It is rooted deep in fibres of my heart.
Iqbal devoid of skill and craft though be,
Through every vein of thought can fully see.
The frenzy in your breast is shorn of glow,
This heart illuming point you ought to know.
Intellect leads a man from God astray,
Philosophy from grasping facts keeps away.
Dumb strains produced by calm and serious thought
Slay zeal for active life and achieve not aught.
True faith and creed give strength to earthly life,
Abraham and Prophetsʹ Seal guide to face its strife.
Aliʹs son, you are deceived by Avicennaʹs thought,
Give ears to what the Holy Prophet taught.
You can not see the path you have to tread,
So choose a guide from tribe of Quraysh instead.
Perhaps the part of year that Spring you deem,
In othersʹ view destructive Autumn it may seem!
The worldly affairs one pattern donʹt retain,
So pilgrim wise, think not of loss and gain!
The thing you take for sky of earthly tract,
Perhaps is soil of some other world in fact!
Though wealth and gold provide, The worldly needs of man
But what faqr can bestow, No wealth or gold eʹer can.
If youth of nation mine, Were jealous of their creed,
My qalandarʹs state wonʹt mind, Alexanderʹs might indeed.
With ease you can divine, To some thing else is due:
Penury can not cause, Decline of Muslims True.
Wealth has played no part, To bring my worth to light
My faqr this spell has cast, The share of wealth is slight.
Knowledge said to me, Love is madness;
Love said to me, Knowledge is calculation—
O slave of calculation, do not be a bookworm!
Love is Presence entire, Knowledge nothing but a Veil.
The universe is moved by the warmth of Love;
Knowledge deals with the Attributes, Love is a vision of the Essence;
Love is peace and permanence, Love is Life and Death:
Knowledge is the rising question, Love is the hidden answer.
Kingdom, faith and faqr are all miracles of Love;
The crowned kings and lords are base slaves of Love;
Love is the Space and the Creation, Love is Time and Earth!
Love is conviction entire, and conviction is the key!
The luxury of destination is forbidden in the religion of Love;
Fighting the storms is permitted, but the comfort of the shore is forbidden;
Lightning is permitted to Love, Harvest is forbidden.
Knowledge is the child of the Book, Love is the mother of the Book.
There is no place in Ind wherefrom to learn, The tenets that the Muslim Faith concern.
They are devoid of zeal for godly acts, And are not wont to seek its basic facts.
The mystics, who were keen their faith to spread, Are silent now and thought for them a dread.
Alas! the state of bondage deprives of zest, Slaves tread the beaten path and relinquish quest.
The jurists are helpless to such extent, Canʹt change themselves but would change Quranʹs content.
How sad, the jurists canʹt shift their outlook, But would prefer to change the Holy Book!
These abject slaves opine and cling to creed, That Holy Book is full of flaws indeed.
They think it incomplete for this fact, Because it fails to teach the slavish tact.
Though unwise, thanks to God I must express
For bonds with celestial world that I possess.
My songs fresh zeal to hearts of men impart,
Their charm extends to lands that lie apart.
In Autumn my breath makes birds that chirp in morn,
Imbibe much joy and feel no more forlorn.
O God, to such a land I have been sent,
Where men in abject bondage feel content.
These are all a wayfarer’s search posts
about whom the Quran says: He taught all the names.
The achievements of Rumi and ‘Attar are stations of dhikr;
the computations of Bu ‘Ali Sina pertain to the station of fikr.
To measure time and space is the station of fikr,
to recite: Exalted be my Lord, Most High is the station of dhikr.
I do not wonder if, To God you find approach:
You know not rank of man, For which you need reproach.
Your worship is devoid, Of grandeur, charm and grace:
Your Call to Prayer at morn, Leaves cold and does not brace
Oft men who donʹt deserve get might and main,
Anon a Personʹs gifts ungraced remain.
Perhaps some rules of Logic are concealed,
Mishaps that lie in wait are not revealed.
There is a fact that all of us can know,
World annals much light on this matter throw.
Fate keeps its eye on what the nations do,
Like two‐edged sword can riddle through and through.
Tauhid has been a living force in the days bygone;
what is it these days? Merely a topic of theology.
If its glory doesn’t make the darkness of character radiant,
Muslim cannot judge his elevated position.
Chief of warriors, I have witnessed your array;
their sheaths are devoid of the sword of Say: He is Allah.
Ah! Neither mullah nor faqih envisages the fact that
Unity of thought without unity of action is imperfect.
What is a nation, or how to lead it?
What clue these leaders of prayers could have of that!
Learning whom God has made, The mate of heart and sight,
Like Friend of God can break, With ease all idols bright.
Cosmos and life are one, The world is one and same
The tale of old and new, Is merely false and lame.
A blossom can not thrive, In meadow full of trees,
Unless some drops of dew, Ally with pleasant breeze.
That ken is vision dim, In which the wise manʹs lore
And sight that Moses viewed, Keep apart and merge no more.
Brahmans dub him as foe to native land,
The English call him beggar on the other hand.
The code of prophet born in Punjab says,
ʺThis ancient Muslim owns many pagan ways.”
When and whence the call to truth shall rise,
“My humble heart is feeling much surprise?”
O Muslim, did you ever think or feel
What is meant by piercing sword of steel?
It is the first hemistich of this verse
That Godʹs Oneness shows in form so terse.
My anxiety for the second half is greater though,
May God the sword of faqr on you bestow
If Muslim true can get this sword in hold
He is Ali the Lion of God, or Khalid bold.
This is an age, our canonist’s new dictum, Assures us, of the pen:
In our world now, The sword has no more virtue.
Has it not reached Our pious oracle’s ear,
That in the Mosque Such sermonizing nowadays has grown Rhymeless and reasonless?
Where, in a Muslim’s hand, Will he find dagger or rifle?
And if there were, Our hearts have lost all memory of delight In death.
To one whose nerves falter at even An infidel cut down,
who would exclaim ‘Die like a Muslim!’
Preach relinquishment Of such crusades
To him whose bloody fist Menaces earth!
Europe, swathed cap‐a‐pie In mail,
Mounts guard over her glittering reign Of falsehood;
we enquire of our divine, So tender of Christendom: if for the East
War is unhallowed, is not war unhallowed, For Western arms?
And if your goal be truth, Is this the right road—Europe’s faults all glossed,
And all Islam’s held to so strict an audit?
Autocrats like Alexander and Genghis, Have trampled men beneath their feet,
Not once but hundred times so far, They brought man down from honoured seat.
The annals right from history’s dawn, The message eternal bear as such,
“O man, with insight great endowed, The wine of might is dangerous much.ʺ
Before this quickly flowing flood, That spreads to all the tracts with speed:
Art, insight, intellect and science, Are carried along like straw and reed.
Divorced from faith, a poison strong, When propped by faith and true belief,
’Gainst poison works with speed, And proves a source of much relief.
Faqr goes to War unequipped, unarmed with glee,
It deals dire blows, if heart of sins is free.
Its defiance and unrest, ever on increase
Give tale of Moses and Pharoah fresh release.
O zealous faqr, you will get your grandeur old,
The Frankish soul is stained with greed of wealth and gold.
Ecstatic Love forbids control of heart
Without breeze the petals do not part.
The fire and light of ego both, The soul of Muslims together bind;
The fire of self is light for life: Godʹs existence brings before the mind.
It fortifies the things of life, It is the cause of all display:
Though Nature always hides this soul, From eyes of mankind far away.
If Muslim Faith offends the West, Let West in its own anger burn:
This faith is known by other name, To ʹJealous Faqrʹ now we must turn.
Life is a like a shell and ego like a drop of April shower—
It is unbecoming a shell if it cannot turn the drop into a pearl.
If the ego is self‐preserving, self‐creating and self‐sustaining,
Then it is possible that even death may not make you die.
The lofty states of faqr are known to few,
The faqr that brings the soul of Quran to view.
When selfhood sees its sway and upper hand,
This exalted state the folk as kingship brand.
This rank gives verdict of a Muslimʹs worth,
And makes him vicegerent of God on earth.

You have got bondage as a fit reward,
For you have failed to keep on faqr a guard.
Prostration made like moon his forehead shine,
Alas! the Franks have snatched that essence fine.
Your stars have lost their pristine glow and sheen
That made them rivals of Sun and Moon so keen.
Your eyes are fixed on miracles that amaze,
But world of events strange attracts my gaze.
No doubt, the world of thought is strange and queer,
But worlds of Life and Death more odd appear.
A call to you is sent by World of Chance,
Perhaps you may transmute it with your glance.
1
Your light is only Europe’s light reflected:
You are four walls her architects have built,
A shell of dry mud with no tenant soul,
An empty scabbard chased with flowery gilt.
2
To your mind God’s existence seems unproved:
Your own existence seems not proved to mine.
He whose self shines like a gem, alone exists;
Take heed of it! I do not see yours shine.
If angelic art and celestial lore, The ills of Muslims can not cure,
Worthless they are and of no use, Of fact so true you must be sure.
Your reveries deep and rapture sweet, Your worship at the midst of night,
If fail to keep a watch on self, Are useless quite and have value slight.
The intellect can cast its noose, On the Pleiades and the Moon;
If heart is bʹreft of love for God, It is not a worthy gift and boon.
If wit incites a man to say, ʺNo God but Heʺ it brings no gain:
It. has no worth at all I think, Unless affirmed by heart and brain.
No wonder great that my discourse, With distraction unbound is fraught:
If it wonʹt spread like rays of morn, It means such talk has value naught!
Only identity of thought, Keeps the Faith thriving—
Doctrine by whose means schism is brought, Is impious striving;
And only the strong hand is fit, To guard the creed:
Let no‐one trust man’s native wit, To serve such need.
But that strength, preacher, we shall not, Find in your hand muster;
Go, and recite in some cool grot, Your paternoster—
And there concoct some new Islam, Whose mystic kernel
Shall be a tame submissive calm, Despair eternal!
—In India, if bare leave be deigned, His prayer‐prostration,
Our dull priest thinks Islam has gained Emancipation.
A heart devoid of love is dead, Infuse fresh life in it again:
It is the only cure for folk, Who suffer from some chronic pain.
Your sea is full of calm and rest, Is it repose or magic art?
No sharks and storms disturb your sea, Intact its coast in every part!
You are not intimate with laws, That rule the spheres that spin around:
The twinkling stars do not disturb, The calm which in your heart is found!
The dormant spark that buried lay, In my extinguished clay since long
Has set afire your bed of reeds, Assuming form of morning song!
That man can only see in full, The world of future and the past,
Who has the luck to be endowed with, With my glance so pert and fast!
The diverse hues of world I can descry,
Here stone and gem, there moon and starry sky.
My insight also gives this verdict clear,
These are hills, river, earth and sphere.
Of facts so true, I strive to hide not aught:
You are, all else a trick that eyes have wrought!
In different garbs and various masks, The idols reappear in every age:
They e’er retain their youth and gloss, Though man has grown old on this stage.
Prostration ’fore God you presume, As irksome, tedious, burden great;
But mind, this homage sets you free, From bonds of men, of might who prate!
Poor intellect canʹt be fit, To be your guide in life:
If led by guess and doubt, Disruption may get rife.
Your zeal infirm and weak, Unlit your thoughts by light:
It is too hard to illume, Your lifeʹs dark dismal night.
’Twixt actions good and bad, Itʹs hard to draw a line,
Unless life undertakes, Such subtle points to define.
The mystics of the present age, Are devoid of warriorʹs rage:
The claim that they are rapt with wine, Of ’Last and turn from Code Divine!
The jurist has such bent of mind, That makes to monkish mode inclined,
In Holy Wars take rock‐like stand, They are just combats hand to hand.
Manʹs flight from conflicts of life, Or escape from its heat and strife:
If these not be abject defeat, What else is then a mean retreat?
Clay‐made man and angelic hosts, All are swayed by wit and mind:
Naught lies beyond the reach of wit, Bestowed by God benign and kind.
Its lasting grandeur holds the world, In perpetual chains that do not break:
The heart alone some courage shows, And full of rage at wit can shake.
The mystic mode has naught except, The inner changes of the heart;
The talk of Mullah on his creed, Is merely piece of fiery art.
The poetʹs song of zeal bereft, Is dead and struck with frost!
To outward eyes he seems awake, Though in thoughts completely lost!
Alas! my eyes do not behold, The holy knight whose fervour high
May cause his blood to seethe and boil, In veins that lend such might to thigh.
A dervish feels no rest at all, Beneath the mound of clods and dust:
Though abysmal dark the grave, Its rigours yet bear he must.
In dark and dismal depths of grave, Silence of skies a man can sense,
But there he can never find, Environs free and space immense.
A Dervish bold proclaims with main and might
My guidance take, tread path quite straight and right!
Beyond your might and nerves my tumults lie,
With caution great by qalandarʹs dwelling hie!
The help of skiff and guide I do not need,
If you are swollen brook, come down with speed!
Has not my takbir broke your charm?
Revoke, if show of courage does not harm!
A dervish holds the reins of time like steed,
He brings sun, stars and moon to book with speed!
The thoughts of young both masked and plain
From qalandarʹs eyes canʹt hid remain.
I know your states for I too crost,
These tracts in times which now are past.
The wise ʹbout words do not quarrel,
He heeds not shell who seeks the pearl.
Men crazed with love of God possess,
Wit that from spark the flame can guess.
An import complex confirmed by heart,
Is precious more than gems in mart.
As good as dead is science and art,
Which took not birth from bleeding heart!
That man alone is brave and free, Whose stroke is full of main and might;
That man is coward through and through, Who leans on guile and tricks in fight.
From creationʹs Immemorial Dawn, Free born men own a bent of mind,
Qalandarʹs traits donning cloak and crown, Such distinctive marks in them we find.
The spark lies hid within their clay, Which the world to itself takes;
Transforms it as if by a smell, And world—illuming sun it makes.
This life is free from ugly taint, That makes men round the fane to tread:
O God! the faithful and pagan all, Have worn on shoulders sacred thread.
Thus Khizr to me did speak, Last day on river banks.
ʺAre you in search of cure, For venom spread by Franksʺ?
I know a subtle point, Which like the sword is keen:
Is cutting, burnished, bright, And owns a peculiar sheen.
A heathen gets distinct, By getting lost in life
Whereas a Muslim true, Keeps ’bove its brawl and strife.
The sedent nations of the East, Or active dwellers of the West;
Are inmates of such dungeons that, Were built by them with zeal and zest!
The priests who guide the Christian church, And elders who maintain the Shrine,
Lack newness of discourse and speech, Bereft are they of actions fine.
Experts in statecraft practise still, The same antique guile and wily tricks
No flights of fancy the bard can claim, To ideals low and mean he sticks!
It is time that the expected Guide, May soon appear on worldly stage;
His piercing glance in realm of thought, Would cause a violent storm to rage.
IN THE WORLD
A man whose faith is firm and strong, Is soft as silk in friendly throng:
In skirmish between wrong and right, Like sword of steel, he stands to fight!
The skies are his inveterate foes, His war with them e’er onward goes:
Though Muslim true of clay is born, From earthly bonds still he is torn.
To hunt the sparrow and the dove, He does not like and does not love:
He much aspires his noose to cast, On angels great and hold it fast.
IN PARADISE
The angels of this thing are sure, That a Muslim can allure;
But Maids of Eden do complain, From society he does oft refrain.
Before assembled Muslim priests,, Bab made a speech with apt remarks;
That fellow could not read aright, ʹSamawatsʹ with its syntactic marks.
The scholars smiled with contempt, At stupid error that he made.
He said with courage and aplomb, They knew not his spiritual grade:
The verses of the Holy Book, By desinential marks were bound;
They were ransomed and set free, For sake of guidance true and sound.
SATAN
Oh God, Creator! I did not hate your Adam,
That captive of Far‐and‐Near and Swift‐and‐Slow;
And what presumption could refuse to You Obedience?
If I would not kneel to him, The cause was Your own fore‐ordaining will.
GOD
SATAN
When did that mystery dawn on you? Before, Or after your sedition?
After, oh brightness! Whence all the glory of all being flows.
GOD (TO HIS ANGELS)
See what a groveling nature taught him this
Fine theorem! His not kneeling, he pretends, Belonged to My fore‐ordinance;
gives his freedom Necessity’s base title;—
wretch! His own Consuming fire he calls a wreath of smoke.
The bonds that in past, like bundle knit, The Faithful Fold, have now been split!
O God sent Guide, let Muslims know, What to do and where to go?
The Arabian Sea is quite bereft, Of stir, there rise no waves and crest;
The tempest that in me is hid, Has no place to spread and skid!
Caravan has left the tramp alone, But mount or food he does not own:
Where can the singing cameleer go, Who rides on hill and waste to and fro!
O Soul, whom God for message chose! This secret hid to me disclose:
Some light on this problem throw, Where may the guard of Godʹs portents go?
What, shall I tell you then, is a Muslim’s life?
Ecstasy’s summit joined with profoundest thought!
Even its setting flames like a rising sun;
Single its hue, yet manifold age by age;
Neither with those times sharing their scorn of virtue.
Nor with times past their bondage to myth and magic,
Firm on eternal verity’s bedrock standing—
Here is true life, no airy conceit of Plato!
Love, that the Spirit harbors, of loveliness Mingles amid its elements
With Iran’s Beauty of mind, Arabia’s inward fire.
What Guidance signifies you wish to know,
Insight, like me, may God on you bestow!
He is true guide and teacher of your age,
Who can with present fill your mind with rage.
By showing the face of Friend in looking glass,
May make your life more onerous and crass.
He may make your blood seethe with sense of harm
And on faqr’s whetstone may to sword transform.
Such guidance means revolt ’against Lustrous Creed
That makes the Muslims bow to kingly breed.
Perhaps your faith is so much quaint and queer,
For faqr and monkery same to you appear.
Faqr has a loathing great for monkish ease;
Its boat is ever tossed by stormy seas.
He yearns to put to test his frame and soul,
Display of self is his main aim and goal.
Its life like touchstone acts for Cosmos vast:
It knows what will perish and what will last.
Ask it if things on which your eyes are bent,
Are real or merely riot of hue and scent!
Since Muslim true of faqr has been bereft,
No Solomonʹs Faith or Solomonʹs awe are left.
A restless aching heart that throbs with Love, Is my lifeʹs only stock and hoard.
Your joys of life consist of wealth and gold, That worldly Science and Arts to you afford.
The marvel wrought by thinkers wise and sage, Consists of problems stiff that thought provoke:
Mount Sinai, Pharoahʹs rout and Mosesʹ Staff, Are miracles worked by those who God invoke.
I have conferred a Muslimʹs name on you, For sake of courtesy, custom and routine:
Though your breath is quite bereft of heat, Of Reckoning Day that shall emit blazing sheen.
My vest is torn to shreds and pieces since long, And this is due to my mindʹs frenzy great:
Your mind is still intact and sound, Wherefore impute the blame to me and slate?
You ought to keep your words within control, If you seek the bounteous glance of guide:
When you talk with those who insight own, Be courteous much, by conduct nice abide.
That nation cannot come to shame at all, Nor shall eʹer come across or face disgrace,
Whose youth are blessed with pluck and courage great, And guard with zeal the prestige of their race.
The twigs and boughs this subtle point explain
That sense of surrounding wide to plants is plain.
The seed is not content with dwelling dark,
It has a craze to spire from earth like spark.
Donʹt bar the path to deeds for Natureʹs claims,
Submission to Will of God has different aims.
If there is pluck for growth, the suburbs suffice;
O man, the world is wide, if you are wise.
The subtle point in Godʹs Oneness hid, With ease in words we can explain;
But what about your mind unsound, That brims with myths and idols vain?
The Elder of the Shrine has traits, That smack of juristʹs faith and creed:
Much thirst for view ‘No god but He,’ Among his fellows cannot breed.
None can appraise the glee one gets, When war is on ’twixt good and bad:
He who canʹt inflict deadly blows, And strokes in war is never glad.
Observations made by free born men, In world with marvels so replete;
To those who own the glance of thralls, None can such wonders ʹfore them repeat.
A dervish holds a loftier rank, Than a monarch who wears a crown;
There is no cure for such a man, Who, like paupers, has sunk down.
With zeal and fervour man is fired:
By looks of man by God inspired!
The intense heat his breath imparts,
A blaze in park and orchard starts!
The mode of hawks the thrush displays,
The birds that chirp change mode and ways!
Such man rapt with Godʹs Love can raise,
Low‐born to rank of Jam and Parwiz!
God save from revelations of a thrall,
Like Genghis, he leads to nations’ fall!
Since times antique the mind of man, In complex problems is involved:
What is the source of clay‐born man, And how the soul has been evolved?
Pain, anguish, glee and rapture sweet, Are spiritual states that man must face:
What is of much worth, cup or wine, Is knotty point you wish to trace?
What binds the words and their import, What links the body and the soul?
It wears the cloak of its own ash, Just like the burnt refuse of coal.
For Muslim true, death has no dread
To realm of souls, he straight is led.
Donʹt ask the rulers of this land, To grant blood price for martyred band.
Their blood is precious and divine, Like precincts of the Holy Shrine.
Alas! the Muslim has forgot, The lesson that to him was taught.
He was ordained to cry to none, Save to God Unique and One.
A gnostic, revivalist, jurist or Expert in Prophetʹs maxims I do not claim:
As such a prophetʹs rank and state, In terms precise I canʹt proclaim.
Despite these things I always keep, On Muslim lands my watchful eye:
To me are known the secrets hid, In depths of this azure sky.
In present age, so full of dusk, I have beheld this fact so stark
That peeps like bright and full grown moon, From sky that wears the mantle dark.
The seer, inspired by God, who fails, To prompt to deeds of might and main,
Is just akin to leaf of hemp, That makes oblivious to loss or gain.
The talisman wrought from mud and clay, Whom we give the name of man,
Is mystery known to God alone, Its essence true we can not scan.
Since Creationʹs Early Morn began, Time is engaged in constant flight,
Has tried to leave its trace on man, But has not met success e’en slight.
If you do not get much disturbed, To you this truth I may unroll
That man, Godʹs image, on the earth, Is neither frame of clay nor soul.
Contemporary era witnessed tremendous contacts among the nations;
The unity of mankind, however, remained concealed.
Western polity advocates division among the nations;
Islam pleads but for unification of humanity.
Holy Makkah has sent a message to Geneva:
Ought there be unity of mankind or unity among the nations?
O Shaykh, who tend the Holy Shrine, Discard these monkish modes of thine:
Grasp what morning songs denote, What aim or end I would promote.
May God preserve the youth you guide, And may they all by Faith abide!
Restraint and order you must teach, To shun conceit you ought to preach.
Those who blow on glass in West, Have taught the youth repose and rest:
Let them imbibe to bear the shocks, And cut the stones and hew the rocks.
The foreign Yoke that ran for periods long, Has drained the blood of heart, so strong;
Think of some cure, panacea or aught, To bring to end their sight distraught.
In fits of frenzy strong and great, Of mysteries, God I start to prate:
Bestow on my distracted brain, Some recompense for this pain.
A nationʹs life gets much prolonged, By lofty aims and ideals high:
If dwellers here some zeal possess, They can explore the heights of sky.
The Frankish Sage by guile and skill, New lease of life to nation gave:
The path for birth of Superman, By valour great he strove to pave.
To Guideʹs concept you seem averse, Too fed up with this thought appear:
This view for Muslims has the weight, That for Cathay has musk of deer.
If man alive puts on the shroud, Must we take that ass for dead:
Or tear to pieces small and shreds, His shroud and cast away the threads?
A Muslim true gets grandeur new, With momentʹs change and every hour:
By words and deeds he gives a proof, Of Mighty God, His reach and power.
To rout the foes, to grant them reprieve, Do pious deeds and show great might:
Are four ingredients that make, A Muslim Devout who shuns not fight.
With Gabriel trusted and steadfast, This clay‐born man has kinship close:
A dwelling in some land or clime, For himself Muslim never chose.
This secret yet none has grasped, That Muslim Scripture reads so sweet:
Practising rules by it prescribed, Becomes its pattern quite complete.
The Faithful acts on aims and ends, That Nature keeps before its sight:
In world he sifts the good and bad, In future shall judge wrong and right.
While dealing with friends and mates, He is dew that thirst of tulip slakes:
When engaged with his foes in fight, Like torrent strong makes rivers shake.
The charm of Natureʹs eternal song, In Muslimʹs life, no doubt is found:
Like chapter Rahman of the Quran, Is full of sweet melodious sound.
Such thoughts that shine like lustrous stars, My brain, like workshop, can provide:
You can select the star you like, So that your Fate this star may guide!
A newborn faith invokes his taste,
Adopts with zeal but leaves with haste.
In search for truth he takes no part,
As disciple stakes both head and heart.
If comments’ snare some hunter set,
From nest on bough would drop in net.
The right of thinking free, a Muslim owns,
Is gift or God which canʹt be checked by frowns.
He can transform the Shrine to Magian fane,
Can deck the Shrine with Frankish idols vain.
Can make the Holy Book the sport of boys,
And can with ease devise new faiths like toys.
In India queer and odd the farce you see,
The Faith is captive, but the Muslims free.
Through all the Western politeia, Religion withers to the roots;
For the white man, ties of blood and race, Are all he knows of brotherhood—
A Brahmin, in Britannia’s sight, Ascends no higher in life’s scale
Because the creed of the Messiah, Has numbered him with its recruits;
All Britain one day might embrace Muhammad’s doctrine, if she would,
And yet the Mohammedan, luckless wight, Be left as now beyond the pale.
It could have never borne fruit and foliage in the space lit up with light,
If from the dark recesses the seed had not moved on:
In life we begin with no and end with yes;
When no is divorced from yes it becomes destructive.
A nation which does not pass from no to yes
Is undoubtedly on the brink of death.
If Amirs of Arabian lands, Donʹt take it for a slur or slight:
This Muslim from the land of Ind, May speak with vigour great and might.
Who were the people whom at first, Godʹs apostle preached kinship close?
Division amongst them was infused, By men like Bu Lahab and such foes.
Their existence does not rest at all: On borders long and deserts vast
Arabian lands subsist because Of blessings of Arabiaʹs Prophet Last.
This problem is not hard to solve, O man, endowed with insight great:
Whʹr to obey dictates of God, Or submit to decrees of Fate.
The Wheel of Fate spins hundred times, Within the twinkling of the eye;
He, who follows freaks of Fate, Anon is down and anon is high.
Herbs, vegetables and minerals alike, Adhere to what Fate pre‐ordains:
But Muslim true obeys laws of God, All else abhors and much disdains.
If self of man perfection gains, Devoid of rest his heart remains:
Even in the niche of grave, Presence and Absence he must brave.
The Moon and stars shine like a spark, For moments few and then the dark:
The rapture caused by egoʹs wine, Is as eternal as things divine.
If your ego is ripe and mature, Your life from Death becomes secure:
Deathʹs angel may earthly frame contact, But can not harm your soul, in fact.
Though change so great has swept the world, There is no need to grieve or smart:
The same the earth and same the skies, By Grace of God, rise! Play your part!
The same hot blood runs in your veins, That raised the cry ʺThe self is Trueʺ
By Grace of God, rise! Play your part! And go in quest of ventures new.
Donʹt mourn or weep for scattered brain, It is a spell that Franks have cast:
This charm with case you can remove, Act, act, anew and leave the past!
SPINOZA
On life is fixed the gaze of persons bright,
What is life? Presence, being, joy and light!
PLATO
A wise man knows that ʹfore death he must bow,
In pitch dark night, life, like spark, soon loses glow.
Both life and death deserve not any heed,
The self of man is ego’s goal and need.
Love fled, Mind stung him like a snake; he could not
Force it to vision’s will.
He tracked the orbits of the stars, yet could not
Travel his own thoughts’ world;
Entangled in the labyrinth of his science
Lost count of good and ill;
Took captive the sun’s rays, and yet no sunrise
On life’s thick night unfurled.
Reality grows blurred to eyes whose vision
Servility and parrot‐ways abridge.
Can Persia or Arabia suck new life
From Europe’s culture, itself at the grave’s edge?
He, who predicts the Fate of man, And keeps his gaze eʹer fixed on sky:
Such man is unaware of fact, That rank of self is very high.
Those who perceive this fact so clear, That dome of sky that spins around,
Has not the height as self of man., ʹBout world have formed an opinion sound.
They are aware of all those things, That charm and repel the human sight:
To them alone this fact is known, What blackens heart, what renders bright.
Your vinteners have despaired me much, Like Samri, they can cast a spell:
With empty bowls to East have come, What they would do is hard to tell.
No lighting new can ever flash, In lap of clouds that float in sky:
Of lightning old, their sleeves are void, How can they gain a status high?
The Western culture depraves both heart and vision,
Because the soul of that culture is no longer chaste.
With a corrupted soul one cannot expect
To have a clean conscience, high thinking and refined tastes.
A nation whose youth are endowed, With self as strong and hard as steel:
No need of piercing swords in war, Such people brave can ever feel.
The world of Pleiades and the Moon, By natural laws is chained and bound;
Whereas the world in which you dwell, Owns insight, will and mind much sound.
What do the quivering waves imply, Save enormous zeal and zest for quest?
What lies concealed in mother shell, Is gift of God Who knows it best.
The hawk is never tired of flight, Does not drop gasping on the ground:
If unwearied it remains on wings, From huntersʹ dread is safe and sound.
If you traverse the road of love, Donʹt yearn to seek repose or rest:
If Layla be your companion close, That litter shun with great contempt.
O streamlet, onward flow and get, Transformed to torrent strong and deep:
If bank is eʹer on you bestowed, Abstain, flow on with mighty sweep.
Donʹt lose your bearings in this world, Because with idols it is full:
The assemblage here can cast a spell, Disdain, or strings of heart shall pull.
Gabriel on Creationʹs Early Morn, A piece of useful counsel gave:
He bade me not accept a heart, Enchained by mind of man like slave.
Untruth conceals in various masks, But Truth and God are both unique:
There canʹt be pool ʹtwixt good and bad— This fact is known from times antique.
I donʹt belong to Faris or Hind, To Iraq or Hijaz donʹt trace my breed:
The self to me this much has taught, Spurn both the worlds and pay no heed
You are a heathen in my view, The same to you may seem my creed
To count the breath, your faith and goal, While melting breath my job and deed.
Your change, no doubt, is good and well, And so your change of Muslim creed:
This Faith is meant for men, like hawks, It suits not pheasantsʹ quivering breed.
Such passionate Love of God and craze, In wilds and wastes has not caught my sight,
Whose magic force and rapture great, The faults of reason may set right.
A poet must neʹer keep aloof, From noisy fretful stream of life
The bard, who shuns the facts and truths, Canʹt make the nation face its strife.
The Truth‐seeking man whose self has awakened
Is like a sword which is cutting and brilliant.
To his keen eye is visible
The power to show what is latent in every atom.
To him you cannot be compared:
You are the slave of the heavens while he is their master.
You have not yet developed even a desire for the shore;
He has grasped the secrets of the deep through the purity of his soul.
If self is bred with perfect care, Such force and strength it can acquire
That handful dust of man with ease, Can set untruths and wrongs afire.
This is the mystery we ascribe, To Moses in every age and clime:
He tended the sheep in wilds and learnt, From Shoaib to toil and mode sublime.
Free thinking can bring ʹbout the ruin, Of those whose thoughts are low and mean:
They donʹt possess the mode and style, Of though that may be chaste and clean.
If thoughts are raw and immature, No good accrues to man in least:
The utmost that such thoughts can do, Is change of wan to state of beast.
If the self is alive, even poverty is kingship:
The prestige of the penniless is not inferior to that of Sanjar and Tughral.
If the self is alive, the endless ocean is fordable;
To a live self the stones of a mountain are soft like silken cloth.
A live crocodile is free when encircled by water,
While a lifeless crocodile is enchained even by the wave in a mirage.
My talk makes Shaykh and Mullah show wrath undue,
Though disciples can put up with what is true.
That race is soon deprived of glorious deeds,
For talk on Being and Attributes hatred breeds.
This cosmos old is wrought in such a cast
That tavern, saki and flask donʹt for eʹer last.
That nation has the right to luck in life
Whose youth for honey take worldly blows and strife.
About the self here have no talk, O bard,
Because with schools such sermons donʹt accord.
Much good that birds that chirp may not descry,
The modes of hawk, its state and rank so high!
A free manʹs breath can match a subject year,
How slowly moves the time of serfs, is clear!
The free perform such deeds in span of breath,
But slaves are every instant prone to sudden death.
The thoughts of persons free with truth are lit,
But thoughts of slaves do not own sense a bit.
A slave has craze for marvels wrought by guides
Himself a wonder ʹlive, his memory fresh abides.
This is the training that befits them well,
Painting, music and science of plants as well.
Existence and knowledge both are poles apart,
Life burns the soul, whereas lore makes it smart.
Joy, wealth and power all, to lore are due,
How irksome that to self it yields no clue!
No dearth of lettered men, ah few! provide
The bowl with wine of gnosis like true guide.
The ways of teachers donʹt expand the heart,
Matchstick canʹt light to electric lamp impart.
Just like the stars that shine in azure sky,
Thoughts have short span of life and soon they die.
The realm of self has its ups and downs,
Even here, the Fair and Foul exchange their frowns.
If self has reached the height, its acts are fine,
Debased, its deeds as good one canʹt define.
Devoid the West of inner light, Her soul is struck with deadly blight
The loss of self has made the East, A leper, for germs befitting feast.
The Arabs have lost their former zeal, Their souls are shrunk, they can not feel;
Iraq and Persia are bereft, Of bones and veins and naught is left!
The self of Indians is extinct, By pinions cleft is made distinct
For they are pleased with prison life, To break the bars they wage no strife!
Demise of self has made divine, Who keeps a watch on Holy Shrine,
To sell the robes that pilgrims don, On sale proceeds he lives upon.
The minds of those who go to school, In thoughts quite fresh and new are clad:
Alas! there are such people few, Who draw a line ʹtwixt good and bad.
Perhaps some luminous thought may flash, Across the inmost part of heart
For such inspiring thoughts one must, Set some recess in heart apart.
Wherefrom a man can find, Ripe thoughts in present age?
The weather of this park, No ripeness can presage.
The seats of learning give, The mind of pupils scope:
But leave the thoughts of youth, Unlinked by thread or rope.
The love of God is dead, By unbelief ’mong Franks:
Through lack of link in thoughts, East shackles wears on shanks.
God bring you acquainted with some storm!
No billow in your sea break in foam,
And never from books can you be weaned
Which you declaim, not comprehend.
Thus mountain stream to pebble spake,
“This lowly state for height you take.
You are tread upon and suffer deal,
How nice! my need the rivers feel.
You never clashed against a wall,
Donʹt know, a stone or glass to call.ʺ
This age that’s with us is your angel of death,
Its bread and butter cares catch your soul’s breath.
Your heart recoils from shock of combat; life
Is death, that deadens in men the joy of strife.
Learning estranged you from such exaltation
As would not let man’s mind desert its station;
A falcon’s eyes were yours by Nature’s right,
Slavishness left them only a poor wren’s sight,
And the schools hid from them those mysteries
That yield to hill’s and deserts still assize.
The subtle point that God is one, The German sage could not perceive:
Clear sight and mind are both a must, So that this point one may conceive.
The flights of fancy, like a dart, Can hit the dome of azure sky:
He casts his noose on moon and sun, That seem so far above and high.
Although his natural bent of mind, From stains and blemish is quite free;
His soul this dormant fact betrays, He yearns for life replete with spree.
If you desire to breed such ruby which is red,
Donʹt beg light of sun that from course has fled.
The world is trapped by traditions old and hoar,
Preceptors helpless quite, can do no more.
Those who deserved to lead the modern age,
Have worn out brains and others hold the stage.
That man alone in life shall find, To aim and end a certain sign:
Whose eyes in pitch dark night can see, And like the eyes of panther shine.
The slaves can get repose and rest, In world confined by Time and Space;
But men of high and noble birth, Havenʹt leisure in worldly race.
The progress great that West has mad, Has bedazzled your eyes a deal:
May Prophet guard your precious sight, To vouch him God did Najm reveal!
These revels do not last for long, Like guests they stay for a breath or so;
The bowls of wine that glint like stars, Are soon deprived of gloss and glow.
The books have marred your taste and zest, To such a great and vast extent,
That breeze of morn has also failed, To give you clue of rose and scent!
I know the modes of those who guide the creed,
Though lacking truth, of vision boast indeed.
The teaching that the English have devised
ʹGainst faith and ties has great intrigue contrived.
That race is doomed to bondage and much pain,
Which justice for its ego canʹt attain.
The faults of one man Nature can reprieve,
But groups for crimes no pardon can receive.
(1)
The present age destroys the faith and creed,
Like pagans has a bent of mind indeed.
The threshold of a saint is higher far
Than court of worldly king or mighty Czar.
It is a period full of magic art,
With spell so strong all play their part.
The fount and source of life is parched and dry,
No more the wine of gnosis can supply.
The shrines are empty of such saintly folk,
Whose glance good manners taught with single stroke.
The house, your presence illumes like a lamp,
Has mystic trend in veins and bears its stamp.
If essence of Godʹs Oneness be in heart,
The lore of Franks can cause no harm or smart.
On rose twigs chirp, for long there do not rest,
In selfhood you must seek your home and nest.
A man is ocean that is vast and free,
Its every drop is like the boundless sea.
If peasant is not charmed with life of ease,
A seed can yield a thousand‐fold increase.
I donʹt sit like sluggards and indulge in play,
It is time for your craft and skillʹs display.
(2)
If heart with love of God is not replete,
The life of man remains quite incomplete.
If quarry is wise acute and bold,
It can not be trapped by hunters old.
The Fount of Life in wordly life is found,
Provided you have a thirst quite true and sound.
Your envy for Faith is mystic course indeed,
For growth of faqr a lot of zeal you need.
My darling son, I see no chance at all
That hawk will like to turn a pheasantʹs thrall.
There is no dearth of goods, called verse or rhyme,
There are hundreds of poets much sublime.
My reach and might in world is this alone
That ʹneath the roof I cry, complain and groan.
In speaking truth I am much bold and frank,
In eyes of men I hold a lofty rank.
A son can not acquire his sireʹs renown,
Unless His grace by Mighty Lord is shown.
Nizami, the poet great of Persian tongue,
Gave counsel wise to son who still was young:
“On occasions where your greatness must prevail
Your lineage there wonʹt be of much avail.ʺ
(3)
The days and nights a Muslimʹs toils enhance:
Both creed and rule are like a game of chance.
Men drunk with zeal for deeds nowhere are found,
The rest are fond of talk with idle sound.
If you have courage great and ample force,
Seek such faqr which in Hijaz has its source.
This brand of faqr such virtues great can grant
That make man, like God, free from every want.
His hawk‐like status can spread general death
Of sparrows, pigeons all in single breath.
The glance of mind by its means burns and blazes
Without collyrium begged from Avicenna and Rhazes.
If temper of Ayaz is free from every slavish trend,
Like Mahmud can win grandeur which hasnʹt end.
Your worldʹs Sarafil has neither taste nor zeal,
He canʹt blow trumpet nor can skill reveal.
Its glance a world‐wide tumult can inspire,
In obscure mode sets right the things entire.
A warrior who can this Jealous Faqr attain,
Without sword and lance great conquests he can gain.
It sets the faithful free from need and want,
Beg God that such faqr to you He may grant.
To solve this riddle thinkers have much tried,
Their efforts all so far it has defied.
No doubt, to womanʹs faith and conduct clear,
The Pleiades and moon do witness bear.
This vice in Frankish way of life we find,
Men fools and blind, canʹt read a womanʹs mind.
Ask the wise men of Europe, who have hung
Their ring in the nose of Greece and Hindostan:
Is this their civilization’s highest rung—
A childless woman and a jobless man?
Great change the lofty spheres have met,
O God! the world has not budged as yet.
In man and wife is no contrast,
They like seclusion and hold it fast.
The sons of Adam still wear the mask,
But self hasnʹt peeped out of the casque.
Much greed for show and fame, Has put this age to shame:
The glance is bright and clear, Heartʹs mirror, but is blear.
When zeal and zest for sight, exceed their greatest height,
Thoughts soar to highest point, And soon are out of joint.
That vernal drop of rain, The state of pearl canʹt gain
If destined not to dwell, In lap of mother shell.
Retreat is blessed state, ʹBout self gives knowledge great:
Alas! this state divine, Isnʹt found in fane or shrine.
The picture that this world presents, From woman gets its tints and scents:
She is the lyre that can impart, Pathos and warmth to human heart.
Her handful clay is superior far, To Pleiades that so higher are
For every man with knowledge vast, Like gem out of her cask is cast.
Like Plato can not hold discourse, Nor can with thunderous voice declaim:
But Plato was a spark that broke, From her fire that blazed like flame.
I know quite well that one despoils, While other is like candy sweet:
I can not give a verdict true, Which needs of Quest can fully meet.
I like to make no more remark, And earn the wrath of present age:
Already the sons of modern cult, ʹGainst me are full of ire and rage.
The insight owned by woman can, This subtle point with ease reveal:
Constrained and helpless, wise and sage, With knotty point they can not deal.
It is an uphill task to judge, What is more precious, lends much grace:
Emancipation for fair sex or aught, Or emerald‐wrought superb neck‐lace?
A fact alive is in my breast concealed,
He can behold whose blood is not congealed.
To wear a veil and learn new lore or old,
Canʹt guard fair sex except a person bold.
A nation which canʹt see this truth divine,
Pale grows its son and soon begins decline.
If Frankish culture blights the motherly urge,
For human race it means a funeral dirge.
The lore that makes a woman lose her rank
Is naught but death in eyes of wise and frank.
If schools for girls no lore impart on creed,
Then lore and crafts for Love are death indeed.
The spirit of man can display its self without obligation to another,
But the spirit of woman cannot fully reveal its self without another’s help.
Her desire is the secret of her fever of sorrow:
Her existence is full of fire with the wish to create.
Here is the fire which opens the secrets of life;
That is the heat which sustains the struggle between to be and not to be.
I too feel sad about the oppression of women,
But this knotty problem cannot be resolved.
Music, religion, politics, knowledge, art
Have all in their possession matchless pearls.
They emanate from the mind of a creature made of dust,
But higher than the stars is their abode.
If they protect the ego, they are life itself;
If they cannot, they are mere magic and false tales.
People have come to grief under the sky
Whenever their religion and their literature Have been divorced from egohood.
New worlds derive their pomp, From thoughts quite fresh and new
From stones and bricks a world, Was neither built nor grew.
The firm resolve of those, Who depths of self explore,
Transforms this stream to sea, That has no marge or shore.
The fellow same is lord, Of freaks of fate and strife,
Who with eʹery breath he draws, Creates an eternal life.
The death of self has made, The lands of East effete:
Men who Godʹs secrets share, In these realms are deplete.
The air of waste gives out, The smell of friendship deep
Perhaps there may be some, Who may my company keep.
Poets and priestly class denote and show, The shops of those who blow the glass.
What pity! the mad frequents the wilds and lanes, To smash these shops, this way he does not pass.
Few know that madness can with ease display, A myriad crafts, accomplishments and skill,
Provided one can completely wean it of, The wastes and deserts, from gorge and hill.
The concourse as well as the air of school, Accord with it and tickle its sense of joy:
As lonely site and haunt for him arenʹt must, At school he never feels cast down or coy.
I must complain of your self‐flaunting airs—
My secrets, when you go unveiled, lie bare.
Instead of floating like a truant spark,
Seek out the fastness of some glowing heart!
What should my eyes, but an architect’ Nimbleness,
see in this shrine Of the West?
It knows nothing of God, Mosque?—the Frankish illusionists
Have smuggled into the carcass Of a shrine, an idol‐hall’s soul!
And who built this palace of idols?
The same robbers whose hands have turned Damascus into a desert.
Now Love from mind must take the lead, By God bestowed on human race:
To dear oneʹs lane it must not go, And bring with haste on head disgrace.
Love must infuse new soul in old, Poetic moulds and change their course,
Or break the chains of antique soul, Set it free from mimetic force.
The Spring has come with tulips wild, They seem like carvans on the move:
The youth, their charm and ecstatic joy, Of colossal worth and value prove.
The sea that has no bound or marge, And azure sky that seems so high,
When pitch dark night has upper hand, They gleam and glint like stars in sky.
How nice the bride‐like moon appears, While touring sky in van of night!
At morn, the sun presents a scene, Much grand in sky so blue and bright.
One must have eyes to see these sights, Which vie with each in bloom and grace:
For Nature is not wont to sell, The charm appearing on her face.
Now naught remains in Muslimʹs breast, His heart devoid of glint and glow:
He avowed with zeal ʹNo God but He,ʹ But dead and cold the zeal for show.
The Muslimʹs state has so declined, That Nature fails to know at sight,
Because the slavish acts of Ayaz, Have put Mahmudʹs high rank in plight.
You have withstood the ruin of Time, And kept your ground as firm as rock.
Constraint has turned the Muslims weak, You put them all to shame and shock.
The worship of such Muslims suits, Your structure immense and so vast,
Who with one breath that God is Great, Find truth and lies away cast.
The Muslimʹs breast is quite bereft, Of previous heat and ardour strong:
His blessings, worship are devoid, Of innate heat and fret since long.
His call to prayer is devoid, Of lofty tones and grandeur great;
O God, let this be known to him, Will you let him ʹfore you prostrate?
Your beingʹs sanctum gets, From self its inner light:
Save zeal and firm resolve, Naught can make life eʹer bright.
Its rank is higher than, The Pleiades and the moon:
Your essence and its gifts, Are egoʹs greatest boon.
God save that alien self, Seek shelter in your shrine!
The creed of idols shun, Donʹt desecrate house divine.
Forgetfulness of self, Imports the height of art,
But with the loss of self, Both joy and warmth depart.
(1)
The sun conveyed this message to its rays
ʺWhat wonder great, the change of nights and days!
You have been rambling since aeons in space,
But hate among men is increasing pace.
To shine on sand affords no pleasure sound,
Nor peace, like breeze in making flowerʹs round.
Be lost in fount of light that gave you birth,
Forsake the park, the waste, the roof and earthʺ.
(2)
The rays rise from every nook of space,
Make haste to take the sun in fond embrace.
Loud roar persists, there canʹt be light in West,
For smoke makes West enrobed in able vest.
Though East is not bereft of inner light,
Yet quiet of tomb prevails like Celestial Height.
O sun that light the world keep us in mind,
Hide us in breast so bright and kind.
(3)
A shameless ray as proud as houriʹs glance
Bereft of rest, like mercury eʹer at dance,
Implored the sun to let it spread its light
Till every mote of East grows lustrous bright.
The dark surroundings of Hind it wonʹt forsal
Till natives sunk in slumber do not wake.
The hopes of Orient on this region hinge,
The tears that Iqbal sheds on it impinge.
The moon and Pleiades get light from this land,
Its stones are costlier than gems of purest brand.
It has produced men who hid sense can see,
With utmost ease can cross the swollen sea.
The harp whose music warmth to gathering lent
The plectrum alien is with force quite spent.
The Brahman guards the fane and sleeps at gate,
The Muslim in mosqueʹs niche bewails his fate.
Donʹt shun the East, nor look on West with scorn,
Since Nature yearns for change of night to morn.
With courage great a war I wage, ʹGainst evils of the present age:
I do not bear a fighterʹs name, To chieftainship I lay no claim.
I am not conscious ʹbout this fact, If it is verse or other tact:
God has bestowed on me since long, His praise, reflection, charm and song.
The flood of light that makes its show, On true and faithful Muslimʹs brow:
With grandeur same is quite replete, That fills beingʹs soul and makes complete.
You do not call it unbelief, No less it is than disbelief:
That truthful man may get content, I With today, for change show no intent.
Donʹt grieve, for millenniums and aeons more, Still lie ahead for man in store:
The ever spinning heaven blue, Is not devoid of planets new.
Contents of soul this world can not conceal,
For every mote has longing to reveal:
The course of life somewhat distinct appears,
If eager looks and sight become corn‐peers.
The members of a subject race, By dint of glance, its gloss and grace,
Have acquired the right and claim, To rule and get renown and fame.
The glance has might to cause defeat, It has the strength, its foes to beat:
We see through glance great charm and grace, It brings the lovers face to face.
Through self‐same glance my craze imparts, To motes and their most inner parts,
The wont and mode of wandering tramps, Who pay no heed to need of camps.
If fervent glance and vision keen, You have not met or ever seen;
Your being is a source of shame, On heart, and sight can bring a blame.
Sun, moon and Jupiter shine their hour;
Your self burns on, fed by Love’s power.
Your creed knows nothing of race or hue:
No credit in white or black, or blue!
Where selfhood droops, doubts fight ding‐dong;
Where it blooms—a world of verse and song!
If your soul rot under slavery’s blight,
Your art an idolater’s soulless rite;
If sense of your own greatness sway you,
Legions of men and Jinn obey you!
O fearless wave, at bed, Of river gems are found.
What are the gifts of coast? There dust and thorns abound.
The temper of lightning flash, That darts, my spark contains,
But still your bed of reeds, Is moist and sap retains.
The age in which you live, Is influenced by you:
To spheres that ever spin, It can no way be due.
I have come ʹcross in life, Men with such craze and pluck;
They could darn with much ease, The rents produced by Luck.
That man is toper fine, Who owes, no debt to wine:
Such men are very few, They raise no cry or hue.
The East has taverns still, Where you can find such wine,
Which makes perception dull, With grandeur gleam and shine.
Men with vision bright, For West have hope so slight:
The hearts of West arenʹt chaste, For actions good havenʹt taste.
O man, your stay and show beneath the sky, Is short and brief, like spark, that parts from flame:
Who can make man detect this fact so clear, That being of man enjoys high rank and name?
If craftsmanship of man is quite devoid, Of gift and tact the self to form and frame,
Alas! such art and music of the flute, Are naught but source of much disgrace and shame.
Schools and taverns can no morals teach, Save the fact that you do not exist:
Learn ʹto beʹ for you too are a fact, Besides, your ego thus shall long subsist.
Whence does the zest of liquor come, In mournful tune of hollow reed:
Is its main‐spring the playerʹs heart, Or does it from the pipe proceed?
What is the source of heartʹs great might, Wherefore to rapture it is prone:
How does it topple with a glance, The firm and mighty Achamenian throne?
Why does the heart bestow fresh life, On nations on verge of decline:
Why do its states have constant change, Are points that no one can divine?
Why is it that in eyes of man, On whom God has bestowed a heart,
The realms of Syria, Rome and Rayy, Are fake effects in the mart?
The day the minstrel grasps this point, Which is hid in depths of heart,
Take it for granted, you have traversed, All the stages required by art.
BREEZE
I could not find access to tracts, Where stars like pendent lamps do shine:
Tearing vest of tulips and the rose, Was main and foremost duty mine.
I feel an inner urge so great, To bid farewell to home and depart:
For joyful songs of nightingale, No zeal or zest to me impart.
O dew, Godʹs will has made you know, Full well, both park and heavens high:
What is more precious in your eyes, The dust of park or dome of sky?
DEW
If thorns and straws of worldly mead, To cause a tension in you fail,
Then bear in mind, this lonely park, For heavenʹs dome is like a veil.
The quiet environs of this waste, Whose intense heat scalds the heart:
In forming only dunes of sand, Nature has displayed its Art.
The grandeur of these pyramids, Puts lofty heavens to disgrace
What hand did build, design and frame, They seem attired in lasting grace?
Set your craftsmanship quite free, From Natureʹs chains that bind it tight
For men endowed with gift of craft, Arenʹt prey, of hunters need no fright.
The craftsmen by their tact have built, Such works that Eden jealous make:
The eyes endowed with sight can see, States hid that stir the heart and rake.
There is no self nor usual change, Of morn and night at all is found
The Muslims have got rid entire, Of combats and shun such a round.
Ali! the infidel poor still, Pays homage to his idols old
Though their broken state he knows, Yet on him they retain their hold.
You are a corpse and your art, The leader of your funeral rite
In pitch dark bed‐room of the grave, Of life the fellow catches sight.
In Eden Sinai to Rumi told, That people living in the East,
Still eat their bread and beans from begging cups, They have not made progress least.
Hallaj relates that thus at last, A man in India has appeared,
Who with efforts firm and strong, The webs that hid the self has cleared.
O people with observing eyes, A taste for observation is a good things, but
What good is observation if it does not see, The inwardness of things?
The aim of art should be to generate, A vital flame that never dies.
What use is a mere momentary spark?
What good, O rain‐drop, if you do not agitate The bosom of the sea,
And are content to be, A pearl lodged in a mother‐of‐pearl’s womb?
What good a breath of morning breeze, Whether as poet’s verse or singer’s air,
If it can only make the garden wilt?
O never without miracles do people rise;
What good is art that does not have, The impact of the rod of Moses?
FLOWER
Perhaps you fancied, My land is far off, sky‐herald!
No, it is not far.
DEW
But only laboring wings
Prove earth not far from heaven!
DAWN
Softly as morning, Enter this garden
Not trampling its dewdrop pearls,
Clasp hill and desert, yet still
Catch in your hands the sky’s robe.
Khaqani, the author of Tuhfatularaqain,
Is dear to those who truths can scan.
His wisdom is so sharp and keen,
From truths he can remove the screen.
With world of meanings he is free:
They dare not say ʺyou can not seeʺ.
Ask him what does this world imply,
Where does the cause or tumults lie?
He knows the world of requital well,
His maxims with much wisdom swell,
“Opinion ʹbout world you can derive,
Adam dead, Satan still alive!ʺ
Your half‐shut eyes still fail to see
What subtle fact this life may be.
Too meek to have a fondling will,
Devoid of qiam your worship still.
For songs of Rumi you havenʹt ears sharp,
Snapped the strings of your selfʹs harp.
If you behold the world with gaze much bright,
Of you the sky may beg morning light.
The sun may beg light from gleam of your spark
Your Luck may shine, from moonʹs brow, mark!
The sea may swell with lustrous waves of gems,
Put world to shame with art that from you stems.
You beg and borrow thoughts of othersʹ brains,
Find approach to self, donʹt take much pains!
Is it a fact or delusion mere, Which has been caused by erring eye:
Do earth, hills, deserts vast exist, And is there any azure sky?
Some aver that they do exist, Whereas some call their being untrue;
O God, it is very hard to find, To truth or falsehood certain clue.
Bedil resolved this tangled knot, With so much skill and manner nice,
Though sages and wise men of the past, To undo this skein had no device.
ʺIf heart of man were vast enough, This mead would have retained no trace
Some wine has overflowed the brim, Because the flask had narrow space.ʺ
With Hyderʹs might and brawn, I feel myself content
I wish you joy of wit, To you by Plato lent.
This is the charm and grace, In view of mine and sight
That heavens too prostrate, Before much main and might.
Without great majestic height, Grace is not of much use:
Song is mere puff of breath, If rapture canʹt produce.
I would not go to hell, Whose fire is dull and tame:
To suffer for my sins, I like a rearing flame.
The death of fancy is so widely spread
That men of Pers and Ind by Franks are led.
I feel sad that Behzads of modern time
Have lost Eastʹs rapture sweet and joy sublime.
O artist, of your talents I can tell,
You know the ancient crafts and new so well.
You have portrayed many a natural sight,
Display your self in Natureʹs mirror bright.
The bass and treble of minstrelʹs song, Much joy to human heart imparts:
What is the use of pleasure that, Is eʹer on wings and soon departs?
That melodious song is still unborn, And is concealed in heavenʹs breast,
Whose intense heat may transform, The solid stars to liquid form.
A song that may have such results, Which set men free from grief and pain,
And makes Ayaz break slavish And learn like kings to rule and reign.
Perplexing maze of moon and stars, May flop down, leave their course:
O God, you shall last and the cry, ʺGod is Great,ʺ uttered with much force.
The song that jurists of the self, Deem lawful in their mystic creed,
Has been expecting since a long, A bard, who can acquit indeed.
My remembrance lacks the warmth, And zeal that mystics oft attain:
My thought is not a scale at all, For deeds deserving need or pain.
I wish that jurist of the town, Who knows the rules that Prophet taught
And is adept at Book revealed, To my own point of view be brought.
If in the music or its strains, The message of decease is hid
Such music of harp, reed and lute, In view of mine is quite forbid.
To own the flow of brook, And meander on the earth
In gaze of mine hasnʹt charm, And canʹt endow with mirth.
O dear young man, divert, A bit aside your eye:
The water of the fount, By innate force surges high.
In lands of East, the bed of reeds, For pipe, the breath of minstrel needs;
O poet, let me this much know, ʺIf you have breath in breast, or no?
If nationʹs self grows too much weak, By chains of bondage and much meek,
It need not hear the Persian strains, For these will only add to pains.
If flask of glass shines like the day, Or is a pitcher made from clay:
Like sharpness of a sword of steel, To palate must its relish feel.
There is no land or home on earth, Beneath this spinning azure dome,
Where one without great stress and strain, The thrones of Jam and Kai may gain.
On Loveʹs way numerous Mounts Sinai appear, God manifests Himself so clear,
May stage of Love for ever last, And may not come to end too fast!
The Persian Muse is mirthsome and heart‐easing,
No whetstone for the sword‐edge of the self.
Better the song‐bird of the dawn be still,
Than by her notes lull flowerland into languor.
What use the patient axe that hews through mountains
Yet leaves Parvez and his proud throne unscathed?
This is an age, Iqbal, for craving flint:
From all glass‐wares they show you, turn away.
Their opinions bury love and enthusiasm,
In their dark ideas is the tomb of nations.
In their temples they carve symbols of death,
The art of such Brahmins is disgusted with life.
They conceal high goals from view;
They put the spirit to slumber and awaken the body.
The senses of the poor Indian poets, painters
And literary writers are obsessed by woman.
His contempt has no bound, His Loveʹs depth none can sound:
His wrath on men of God, Is tempered in manner odd.
Nurtured in mimicryʹs gloom, To tread like sheep his doom;
But he is much inclined, To creative bent of mind.
In midst of surging throng, He keeps aloof for long:
Like lamp, he lights the hall, But has not mate at all.
Faqr can like sun of morn, With light the mead adorn:
Its speech is frank and free, Though meanings tenuous be.
Its views vary with the rest, It deems them right and best;
Its innate slates unknown, To mystics with renown.
Decrees of Fate are not concealed, From man whose heart throbbing seems:
He sees the image of new World, In slumberous state, during dreams.
When prayer call at early morn, Transports him to Morpheusʹ domain,
He tries to build the world beheld, With utmost might and utmost main.
The body of the dreamt of world, Is made from his handful clay:
ʹʹGod is Great!ʺ his slogan shrill that can, The role of soul for new world play.
It is a gift by God bestowed, To coin fresh words with meanings new;
Yet skilful artist must work hard, As inborn trend is owned by few.
It is the heat in masonʹs blood, Who builds structures of various forms:
It may be Behzadʹs picture hall, Or house of wine where Hafiz charms.
Without resort to incessant strife, No skill or art completion gains:
If Farhad does not hew the rocks, No sparks flash, dark his house remains!
A song that fails to make your face, Glimmer and glow with joy and glee,
Shows that minstrelʹs blood is cold, His heart of heat and warmth is free.
That player on the flute who has, A conscience much defiled, impure,
With puff of breath can make a tune, Replete with poison which hasnʹt cure.
I have visited the meads in East, And West, where tulips parks adorn;
But I have not beheld a park, Where tulips have their collars torn.
How lofty was that Chinese’s self, Who for crime was condemned to death.
On eve of his beheading, he asked headsman, ʺStop for a span of breath!ʺ
He asked for stoppage many times, For it was very pleasant scene:
He wished to see for moments few, The swordʹs great‐glimmer, glow and sheen.
I do not know the mysteries of poetry.
This point, however, is clear from the nation’s history.
That poetry which is a message of eternal life
Is Gabriel’s song or Israfil’s trumpet‐call.
The souls of Satan and Gabriel too, From verse derive effulgence strong,
For dance and music both provide, Pathos and rapture for the throng.
A Chinese sage has thus disclosed, The secrets implied in this art:
ʺAs if verse is musicʹs soul, And dance performs bodyʹs part.ʺ
It is the mode of worldly men, Against the world to whine and groan;
It does not suit a dervish true, By Fate‐inflicted wounds to moan.
The wise old man explained to me, This subtle point in closet alone:
That control on self daring shows, Whereas plaints breed more guile and groan.
To Europe leave the dance of serpent limb:
The prophet’s power is born of the spirit’s dance.
That breeds the craving flesh, the sweating palm,
This breed the race of pilgrim and prince.
From wont and ways of nations all, These facts so clear with ease I learn,
The Russians seem to be in haste, To gain the goal for which they yearn.
The world is red tip with the modes, That arenʹt in vogue and are outworn;
My intellect, that was tame and mild, Much pert and insolent has grown.
These mysteries which the greed of man, Had kept in veils of stuff so coarse
Are step by step emerging now, And coming forth by dint of force.
O Muslim, dive deep in the Book, Which was revealed to Prophetsʹ Seal;
May God, by grace on you bestow, Politeness, for good deeds much zeal!
The fact concealed in words so far, ʺSpend what is surplus and is spare,ʺ
May come to light in modern age, And make the meanings clear and bare.
Your chessmatch of research and erudition—Your comedy of debate and disputation!—
The world has no more patience left to watch, This comedy of threadbare speculation.
What after all, sapient economists, Is to be found in your biblification?
A comedy of your nicely‐flowing curves, A sort of Barmecidal invitation.
In the idolatrous shrines of the Occident, Its pulpits and its seats of education,
Greed and its murderous crimes are masked under, Your knavish comedy of cerebration.
Death to man’s soul is Europe, death is Asia
To man’s will; neither feels the vital current.
In men’s hearts stir a revolution’s torrent;
Maybe our old world is nearing death.
The versed in this world’s business I am not,
There are shrewd folk who always know what’s what.
Swim with the tide, flatter Their Excellencies
Of the new dispensation that commences!
Would it be more vicarious, or—polite,
I wonder, to call an owl ‘the falcon of the night’?
One hermit’s eyes grew wet with watching how you fell,
Poor Muslim, under England’s spell.
God give you joy of those high offices, to taste
Whose sweets you laid your own soul waste!
But there’s a thing you cannot, try as you will, disguise
From any knowing pair of eyes:
No slave is given a partnership in England’s reign—
She only wants to buy her brain.
Unbridled luxury, State pomp and pride, Rich commerce;
but to dwell inside That lampless breast all tranquil thoughts refuse.
Dark is the white man’s country with the grime Of engines,
No valley that might see Splendour descending on a burning tree;
A civilization sick before its prime,
At its least gasp—leaving maybe, For caretakers of Christendom, the Jews.
There are poets, there are scholars, and there are sages—
A nation’s days of slavery are not uneventful!
But every one of them—poor creatures!—has a single goal,
Though each is unique in the ideas he expounds:
‘Better teach the lion to take flight like a deer,
So that the legend of the lion’s courage is forgotten!’
They seek to make the slaves feel at ease with their slavery,
Pretending to ‘expound and reason things out’.
Unsearchably God’s edicts move; who knows
What thoughts are stirring up deep in the world‐mind!
Those are appointed to pull down, who lately
Held it salvation to protect, the priests;
On godless Russia the command descends:
Smite all the Baals and Dagons of the Church!
No claim to the future, its joy or sorrow,
Has he in whose soul no hot passion burns now;
Unworthy the tumult and strife of tomorrow
That nation to whole will to‐day does not bow.
The poppy heard my song and tore her mantle;
The morning breeze is still in dearch of a garden.
Ill lodged in Ataturk or Reza Shah,
The soul of the East is still in search of a body.
This thing I am may merit chastisement;
Only—the world is still in search of a gibbet.
Thy rival, God! The Frankish statecraft is,
Though none but rich and great join in its worship.
One sole Archfiend didst Thou from flame make: it
Has formed from dust two hundred thousand fiends.
The present age is really the same old age:
It is either the men of prayer or the politicians who are in charge.
Neither the miracles of those men of prayer Nor the power of government is the reason for it
For centuries the people have been used to slavery.
There is no difficulty about being a master
When the people are entrenched deep in slavery.
The wisdom of the East and West
Has taught me something that will prove elixir to slaves:
Whether it is religion or philosophy, poverty or kingship –
All take firm beliefs as their base.
The words that a nation speaks are dead and its actions are futile
If its heart is bereft of firm beliefs.
None other than the Sphinx, the Dread One, lord
Of the secrets of old times, taught me this:
Strength That in one hour can swerve the fates of nations
Admits no puzzling intellect for rival,
Though many in each age are its manifestations—
Now Moses’ rod, and now Muhammad’s sword.
Those vultures of the West have yet to learn
What poisons lurk in Abyssinia’s corpse,
That rotting carcass ready to fall in pieces.
Civilization’s zenith, nadir of virtue;
In our world pillage is the nation’s trade,
Each wolf aprowl for inoffensive lambs.
Woe to the shining honour of the Church,
For Rome has shivered it in the market‐place!
Enmesh in politics the Brahmin—
from Their ancient altars the twice‐born expel!
The man who famine‐racked still fears no death—
Muhammad’s spirit from his breast expel!
With Frankish daydreams fill Arabia’s brain—
Islam from Yemen and Hijaz expel!
The Afghan reveres in religion: take this cure—
His teachers from their mountain‐glens expel!

Iqbal’s breath fans the poppy into flame—
Such minstrels from the flower‐garden expel!
Conquered the waters, Conquered the air—
Why should old heaven, Changed look not wear?
Europe’s imperialists Dreamed—but their dream
Soothsayers soon may, Read a new way!
Asia’s Geneva, Let Tehran be—
Earth’s book of fate new Statues may see.
A diver after pearls Nature made me,
Though wary of the abysses of the State.
Whomever its legerdemain may captivate,
She sets a term to every monarchy;
Farhad’s hill‐hewing labour still lives on,
Parvez’ conquering might is dead and gone.
A certain European revealed a secret,
Although the wise do not reveal the core of the matter.
Democracy is a certain form of government in which
Men are counted but not weighed.
This land of Syria gave the West a Prophet
Of purity and pity and innocence;
And Syria from the West as recompense
Gets dice and drink and troops of prostitutes.
What, are crimes like Mussolini’s so unheard of in this age?
Why should they put Europe’s goodies into such a silly rage?
Need the pot feel so indigent when the kettle wears a blot?
We are Culture’s twin utensils—I the kettle, you the pot.
You have watched my lust for conquest and dominion with a frown—
But have you not knocked the brittle walls of feeble countries down?
To whose empires is that clever piece of trickery so dear,
By which royal seats survive but kings and kingdoms disappear.
We, the children of the Caesars, strove to water heath and sand—
You could never bear to leave untaxed the earth’s most barren land!
You have plundered tents of nomads of the little wealth they own,
You have plundered peasants ploughlands, you have plundered crown and throne—
And that looting and that killing—in a civilized way—
Yesterday you, you defended! I defend it now to‐day.
What is poor India’s fate ‐who knows? ‐ for up till now
It has been a glittering jewel in some crown!
Its peasant is a corpse that some grave has disgorged –
The corpse’s tattered shroud is still inside the ground;
His soul and his body are in pawn:
Alas, neither the residence nor the resident survives!
It is you who became the willing slave of Europe:
My complaint is against you, it is not against Europe!
It is not hard to find in present age
The place which needs cultureʹs angelic sage.
Where dice and drink are both by law forbid,
And women keep their bodies fully hid.
Although my body has a deep restless heart,
Yet forbearsʹ wont no disgust can impart.
Although deprived of schoolʹs beneficial fount,
On Bedouin’s wit and courage we can count.
The wise ʹmong Franks this verdict declare,
Of culture Arab lands are fully bare.
No truth from me can hide at all its face,
God gave me heart awake and wise, through grace.
In my view statesmanship cut off from creed,
Is Satanʹs slave, has no qualms, but low breed.
By quitting Church, Europe has freedom gained:
This statesmanship is like a giant unchained.
When their eyes on some weak domain alight,
Their Priests as vanguard act to wage the fight.
Iqbal has no doubt of Europe’s humaneness:
She sheds tears for all peoples groaning beneath oppression;
Her reverend churchmen furnish her liberally
With wiring and bulbs for moral illumination.
And yet, my heart burns for Syria and Palestine,
And finds for this knotty puzzle no explanation—
Enlarged from the ‘savage grasp’ of the Turk, they pine,
Poor things, in the clutches now of ‘civilization.’
A Frankish Lord advised his son to seek
Such aim that is always pleasant, neʹer bleak.
If lionʹs temper is to lamb revealed,
It will entirely make its blood congealed.
Much good if regal point remains in heart:
In dominating men sword plays no part.
Pour the self in cultureʹs acid strong;
When it becomes soft, mould it as you long.
On this elixir’s efficacy you can count:
To heap of dust can change a mighty mount!
ALEXANDER
Is your retribution shackles or cold steel?
Your violence on high seas all sailors feel!
PIRATE
Alas! Alexander, you deem it void of blame,
Do men of same craft bear each other shame?
Your craft is blood‐shed and my craft the same,
We are both bandits, in diverse fields play the game!
She’s been at her last gasp, poor wretch, for days
May telling ill news not bring ill news to me!—
Yet though her fate seems sealed, the Church still prays
Her fate may be averted. Well, maybe
After all the Old Man of Europe’s drab will rally
A few days longer, with the devil for ally!
Heaven’s blessing on those brazen Frenchmen shine!
Aleppo’s rare glass brims with their red wine.
—If the Jew claims the soil of Palestine,
Why not the Arab Spain? Some new design
Must have inflamed our English potentates;
This is no story of oranges, honey or dates.
On political leaders what hopes can we fix?
They are wedded to dust, in the dust play their tricks,
Their gaze always fastened on maggots and flies,
A web like the spider’s their ladder to rise.
That caravan’s happy whose chief is endowed
With thoughts light as angels’, and temper as proud.
The causes that make the nations sick, Are quite obscure, too vague and fine:
Although some man may try his best, Yet cause in full he can’t define.
The chiefs and guides of slaves have sunk, So low that it seems so much odd:
If mode of lions is presented to them, They will see naught save guile and fraud.
If a Moses forms a secret league, With the Pharaoh of his time:
For his nation such like‐Moses, Is curse, committing dreadful crime.
‘Why do your priests,’ said to me after prayers, A Turkish hero of the faith,
‘Drag out Their genuflexions so?’
He little knew, That free‐born Muslim, that plain warrior,
What kind of thing slaves’ prayers are!
In this world, A thousand tasks lie ready for the free,
In whom the love of high deeds burns and forges The nations and their laws;
But that fire never Touches the bondman’s limbs,
whose nights and days Stand still under an interdict.
If our Prostrations are long‐drawn,
why should you wonder?
God teach His ministers in India
A way of worship that shall be to all His people an evangel of new life!
I know the fire that burns throughout your frame,
The lands of world still fear its scorching flame.
Your cure in Geneva or London you canʹt trace,
Wind‐pipe of Franks is gripped by Jewish race.
I know that subject nations freedom gain,
If they would nourish self, display its main.
Slavery, slavishness, the root of our Disease;
Of theirs, that Demon holds all power;
Heart‐malady or brain‐malady has oppressed
Man’s whole world, sparing neither East nor West.
This pity is the pitiless fowler’s mask;
All the fresh notes I sang—of no avail!
Now he drops withered flowers in our cage, as though
To reconcile his jailbirds to their jail.
How can I quit this mountain land, Where my sires are interred in rocks
My exile from this land so dear, Is full of anguish, pain and shocks?
From Eternal Dawn You are abode, Of kestrel, hawk and birds of prey:
There rose and tulip do not grow, Nor Warbles nightingale so gay.
Your paths that twist and turn on bills, Give Eden's pleasure to my sight
Your clay emits an ember smell, Your sparkling streams look bright in light.
The kingly hawk can hot become, A thrall to pheasant or a dove
How can a man destroy his soul, For his clay-born body's love?
O zealous Faqr, let me know what, Is your verdict and firm intent:
Would you prefer the British robe, Or your shirt, thread-bare, torn and rent?
The discord that prevails among, The nations is an eternal truth:
This old and tyrant whirling dome, For none of us has any ruth.
Dive into the abyss of Self, And do not yield before despair
The wounds that: world on you inflicts, Is secret means of their repair.
If this truth that God has no peer, Sinks down in inner part of heart
You shall excel in grandeur all, In world affairs shall play great part.
Your prayers can't avert, Decrees of Fate at all
Your Self can change, but none, Knows what else may befall.
If some tremendous change, If human Self e'er shines,
It gains perfection's height, Gets free of world's confines.
The wine and drunkard's cries, May ever live and last
The wont and way of Saqi, And gourd may change too fast.
You beg your God to grant, Your cherished end and goal,
I pray my God to change, Your wish entire and whole,
The Sun, the Moon and Sphere all go astray,
Are vagrants who still straggle on the way.
Alexander fell on world like thunder clap,
But death soon caught him in its deadly trap.
King Nadir plundered Delhi's hoarded wealth,
Whereas his Chiefs put him to sword by stealth.
The Afghans and their hills e'en now remain.
Sovereignty and kingdom are only God’s
Free heroes are Compelled by wont and need,
These change a lion bold to fox indeed.
When Faqr with Self gets free and frank,
Both you and I attain the regal rank.
That Darvesh can build up a nation's Fate
Who never tries to seek the royal gate.
In school the noise of games, debates, Great stir and animation prevail
This abundant joy e'ery moment breeds, New griefs and naught else can avail.
For men of free and noble birth, Such knowledge is a venom dread,
Which makes them earn some barley corn, To fill their bellies with its bread.
O fool, great wisdom and book lore, Have not much worth nor carry weight
To learn a Useful art one must, Put in much strife and struggle great.

If such a craftsman likes, with ease, By dint of skill and magic art,
Like dew, can make from mass of Sun, The rays of light proceed and dart.
In world, if man contrives a thing much sound,
The men of every period make his round.
Don't spoil your Self by blind pursuit.
Take care of precious gem that has no suit.
That nation is welcome to have new ways,
Which has no thought save revels night and days.
Assumption of new modes this fact betrays,
Pretext is sought to follow Frankish ways.
The Romans, Syrians, Hindus too, Have changed and made a great advance
O son of hills, discern your Sell', And sharpness of your Self enhance.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care
If weather is fine. water quite enough, And terrain fertile and plain,
But peasant does not water fields, He is odd and can nothing gain.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care
That river has no weight at all, Whose billows do not swell and rise
That tempest is too weak and low, Whose gales by fury don't surprise.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care.
A person, who stire up and down, His clay, to Self can find a clue:
Kings who possess vast, mighty states, Can be ransomed for peasant true.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self take much care
Self-respect of unlettered men, Your ignorance has saved from harm
Though scholars and savants sell, Their Faith to keep their bellies warm.
O Afghan unaware,
Of your Self have much care
The crow says, "In your wings no charm I find."
The bat says, "You have no craft, are blind."
O hawk, these low-caste birds of vast expanse,
Of azure heaven's twists and turns haven't sense.
They can't know states and rank of hawk aright,
Whose soul grows sight entire at time of flight.
Love's bent of mind is not so mean, And low like that of vicious greed
How can the hopping fly compete, With regal hawk in flight or speed?
To bring about a change in laws, Of park with ease one can engage
And for the nightingale can make, The nest as irksome as the cage.
If some one is about to set, On journey that is hard and long,
He does not wait for herald's sound, Like waves that flow without ding dong.
Though college youth appears alive, Yet he is in the throes of death:
He has no thoughts to call his own, And lives on borrowed Frankish breath.
If you e'er keep before your sight, The nature of your inmost heart
A casual glance of Saintly Guide, With much ease can perform this part.
That youth is held in high esteem, By all the members of his tribe,
Whose prime of life is pure and chaste, Dread blows to him we can ascribe.
In days of war he can surpass, Tile ferocious lions of the wood
When peace prevails in every place, Like Tartar deer is fine and good.
There is no wonder, if his glow, May set the things around afire
To burn the bed of reeds one spark, Is 'nough that from the flame does spire.
God Mighty has endowed him with, A monarch's grandeur, pomp and show
His brand of Faqr has virtues such, That shone on Haider's valorous brow.
Do not look down upon the youth, If his head is devoid of gear:
This lad can claim close kinship with, Those kings who crowns on heads do wear.
The same lamp that illumed your yesternight,
Though gone out, once again may gel alight
A courageless man can 'gainst Time bewail,
Whereas the free Fate's stings, like honey hail.
That youth for noise of wars can not be fit,
Who hearing wail of birds at morn loses wit
I fear that you. have childish bent of heart,
Those selling sweets in West are full of art.
In maze of Latin script and sin, Your bearings, no doubt, you have lost
Belief that none has might save God, Is cure for weak that acts so fast.
A man who likes to hunt the facts, Must quit All hopes of West, is cleat
Its atmosphere is full of charm, But one can't find musk-yielding deer.
The self of man derives much strength, From tears he sheds at early morn
Much good that tulip, like the dart, The marge of some brook may adorn.
This idol-house of hue and scent, Or fane so ancient, old and hoar
Hunts those who don't believe in God, On Muslims has effect no more.
O Shaikh, get all the rich expelled, From precincts of the Holy mosque
For niche of mosque is angry with, Them all for their much impious task.
To me upset appears the Cosmos old,
But I do not know what your eyes behold.
In breasts the morn of Last Day comes to view.
Old thoughts of youth have been replaced by new.
Your hymns at morn can't make amends for Life,
O Elder of the shrine, without much strife.
The Shrines no strength to Self e'er can impart.
Because no sparks from wet flame can depart.
Without a toper's courage, Love, Consists of naught save trick and guile
A man, whose Love of God is great, Has brawny arms and is agile.
Alas the love of case and rest, Among the pilgrims seems profound
A man, who journey's toils may deem, As steed and food, is nowhere found.
O men of plains, do not think, That I teach the beastly mode and art
The lonely desert arid the mounts, The man Self knowledge can impart.
This world observes traditions old, In world to come mere hymns can serve
Forge both worlds and stick to God, If kingly grandeur you wish to deserve.
O pilgrim, who tread mystic path, Your goal with case you can attain
Man's Conscience can bear out this fact, That Faqr's high rank isn't hard to gain.
The steel can never make or forge, A sharp and sturdy sword at all
If steel is smooth and soft, like silk, Such toys, true sword one can not call.
If Faqr possesses no self esteem, It means God Mighty's ire and wrath
If respect for Self keeps in view, To riches great it paves the path.
The Franks have made you oblivious, To Self, otherwise O Believer True,
You are the bearer of happy news, And warn the sinners 'gainst their due.
The nations suffer death, From centre if they part
If they have centre strong, Godhead it can impart,
Such Faqr which has a plaint, Against the toils of life

A godly man even now, By wondrous act can chancre
To tiny mustard seed, A lofty mountain range.
In fight without your heat, No zeal or zest is found:
Where are you godly man, Take part in combat's round
O Sun, arise from East, And sail upon my view
Give all the mountain range, A crimson tinge and hue.
'Mong Muslim men, if one, On firm belief has hold
His glance can set afire, All, whether young or old.
Off and on men are born, In waste or mountain range,
Who by their dint of Faqr, Pot-sherd to bezel change.
You can build up your luck, If courage you can show:
For God has written naught, With His pen on your brow.
This azure vast expanse, That goes by name of sky
If one has Wings for flight, In fact, is not so high.

Sher Shah explained this point with so much grace,
Distinction of tribes leads to much disgrace.
The names of various tribes to them are dear,
The robe of Afghaniat don't like to wear.
Their Islam is to pieces and fragments torn,
Like pagans, girdles by them still are worn.
They worship and adore their idols old,
May God help them deaf blows much bold
That glance can not be termed as true, Which draws; a line 'twixt red and pale
That sight is true which does not like, The light of Sun or Moon to 'vail.
The aim and goal of Muslim true, Is far beyond the bounds of West
Take longer steps and walk space, As this site is not meant for rest.
The marts that sell the wine in West, Always keep their doors ajar:
The rapture caused by Knowledge new, Is removed from sin much afar.
If your frame is bereft or heat, Which words, "No god but He impart",
Then bear in mind this well-known fact, Your soul from body may depart.
The sons of Khans, who own high rank, Shall listen to my humble sound
Though I am dressed in rags and sack, And wear no cap or turban round.
One who resides in desert waste, Or person born on mountains steep
Can keep a watch on aims and ends, That Nature in its view does keep.
He draws no line 'twixt fair and foul, Of culture, whose spell makes you sleep
His Faqr possesses the wealth of kings, Who coffers full of God do as keep.
O warbler of this earthly mead, Why are your songs so sweet and fair
Wherefore, desert hawk, you own, Such grandeur great and daring rare?
O Shaikh, no doubt, the climate of your school, Is so much pure and chaste
But men, like Salman and Farooq, Are brought up in some desert waste.
The fire that Muslim Faith bestows, Is as sharp as the sword of steel,
But after thousand years is born, Its match, who mighty blows can deal.
IBLIS
This ancient game of elements, this base world!
The frustration of the longings of the great Empyrean’s dwellers.
Upon its destruction is bent to‐day that Fashioner of things,
Who gave it the name, “The world of Be it so.”
I inspired in the European the dream of Imperialism:
I broke the spell of the Mosque, the Temple and the Church.
I taught the destitute to believe in Destiny:
I infused into the wealthy the craze for Capitalism.
Who dare extinguish the blazing fire in him,
Whose tumults are stimulated by the inherent passion of Satan?
Who could summon the courage to bend down the old tree,
Whose branches their height to our watering owe?
FIRST COUNCILOR
Stable is the Satanic system, no doubt there is!
It has further strengthened in the commoners their slavishness indeed.
Since the dawn of Time have these helpless mortals been ordained to prostration:
Prayer devoid of the posture of standing erect is their nature’s constant urge.
In their heart no desire can in fact take its birth:
But if it does, perchance, it dies or is left unripe.
What wonders have our hard, persistent endeavours wrought!
To‐day finds the mystics and the priests all as subjects of Imperialism.
Suited to the disposition of the East was this opium indeed:
Otherwise Ilm‐i‐Kalam is no less self‐effacing than qawwali in effect.
What matters it, if the tumult of the pilgrimage and tawaf abides?
For, rendered blunt, lies unused the unsheathed sword of the Faithful.
Whose despair does this latest Ordinance prove:
“To the Muslim in this age is forbidden fighting in Lord’s name”?
SECOND COUNCILOR
Is the clamour for “Government by the people” evil or good?
Art thou unaware of the fresh mischiefs of the world?
FIRST COUNCILOR
Aware am I! but tells me my cosmic foresight:
No danger from what is but a masquerade for imperialism.
We ourselves have dressed imperialism in the garb of democracy
When man has grown to be a little self‐conscious and self‐observant.
The true nature of the system of imperialism lies elsewhere:
It depends not on the existence of an individual leader of a king.
Be it a national assembly of the court of Parviz,
Whoever casts a covetous eye on other’s harvest is a king.
Hast thou not observed the democratic system of the West?
With a brilliant exterior, its interior is darker than Genghis’s.
THIRD COUNCILOR
No cause for anxiety then, if the spirit of imperialism be preserved:
But what counter‐measure to the mischief wrought by that Jew have you?
That Moses without Light, that Jesus without the Cross:
No prophet is he, yet with him a book he carries.
I can hardly explain what significance does the infidel penetrating vision possess:
It is, methinks, the day of reckoning for the peoples of the East and the West.
No greater corruption of human nature than this would be:
Slaves have broken asunder the ropes of the masters’ tents.
FOURTH COUNCILOR
Watch its counteraction in the palaces of Imperial Rome:
Again did we inspire in the descendants of Caesar the dream of Caesar.
Who is coiled round the waves of the Mediterranean?
That now expands like a pine, and then wails like a rebeck!
THIRD COUNCILOR
Little do I recognize him to be a man of far‐sighted wisdom:
(A fool!) who has thus European politics exposed.
FIFTH COUNCILOR (TURNING TO IBLIS)
O thou! the fire of whose breath lends stability to the world‐process:
Whenever thou wished, everything hidden presently did thou reveal.
It is thy fire that has transformed dead earth and water into a world of beauty and endeavour:
Inspired by thy instruction, the fool of Paradise turns a seer.
More closely familiar with man’s nature than thee is not He:
Who among the simpletons is known as God the Sustainer.
Those whose business was confined to sanctifying, singing hymns and going round:
Thy sense of self‐respect has out them to shame for ever, with their heads hanging low.
Though the wizards of Europe all are disciples to thee:
No longer have I faith in their sagacity left.
That Jew, that mischief‐maker, that reincarnation of Mazdak:
Each tunic is about to be torn to shreds by his fanaticism.
Behold! the wild crow is vying with the falcon and the hyena:
Lo, how swiftly does the disposition of Time allow of a change!
It spread about, and covered the whole expanse of skies:
What we unwisely had taken for a handful of dust.
Such is the state of the ghastly dread of the morrow’s disturbance:
To‐day tremble with overwhelming awe, mountains, meadows and rivers all.
That world is going to turn topsy‐turvy, my Lord!
The world which resteth solely on thy governance.
IBLIS (TO HIS COUNCILORS)
Absolute command have I of the world of scent and hue!
The earth, the sun, the moon and the firmaments all!
With their own eyes shall the West and the East witness the Spectacle:
When I but warm the blood of the nations of Europe.
The leaders of politics and the patriarchs of church all:
One call from me would be enough to turn them mad.
The fool who considers it to be mere glass‐work:
Let him dare smash the goblets and ewers of this Civilization.
The collars torn asunder by the hand of Nature:
Can’t be darned with the needle of the Mazdakite logic.
How could I be frightened by these Socialists, straying about the streets?
Wretched and straitened, distracted in mind, incoherent in speech!
The only menace I anticipate may come that community:
Which still a spark of ambition hidden in its ashes retains.
Amongst this people there are still to be seen a few
Who go so far as to perform their ablutions with the tears of pre‐morning hours.
Knows he to whom are revealed the inner secrets of Time:
Not Mazdakism, but Islam is to be the trouble of the morrow.
2
I do know this community is no longer the bearer of the Quran:
The same Capitalism is the religion of the Believer now.
And I know, too, that in the dark night of the East
The sleeve of the holy ones of the Sanctuary is bereft of the white, illuminating hand.
The demands of the present age, however, spell the apprehension:
Lest the Shari‘ah of the Prophet should come to light one day:
Beware, a hundred times beware, of the Law of the Prophet!—
The protector of women’s honour, the tester of men’s capacities, the rearer of worthy men!
The message of death to any kind of slavery!
No sovereigns and no monarchs, no mendicants begging!
It does purify wealth of all pollution:
It makes the wealthy trustees of wealth and property.
What greater revolution in thought and action will there be:
Not to the crowned heads, but to God alone does this Earth belong!
Better, if this Law be kept hidden from the world’s eye:
So much the better, the Believer himself is deprived of inner conviction.
Better that he remains busy and entangled in the metaphysical theology:
Better, that he remains busy and entangled in the interpretations of the Book of God.
3
Whose cries of God is Most High could break the charm of the universe:
May the dark night of that God‐thinking man not ever turn bright!
Is the Son of Mary dead or is he endowed with eternal life?
Are the Attributes of God separate from God, or do they form what He is?
Does the expected mean Jesus of Nazareth?
Or a Renewer, endowed with the attributes of the Son of Mary?
Are the letters of the Word of God New or of Old?
In which of the doctrines does the salvation of the Blessed Community lies?
Are not enough to the Faithful in this age:
These idols of worship carved by Metaphysical Theology?

Our safety lies in that Believer remains a slave till Doomsday:
Renouncing this transitory world for others’ sake.
What is good in his case is that poetry and mysticism
Which may keep hidden from his eyes the game of Life.
Every moment do I dread the awakening of this community
Whose religion is, in reality, nothing short of taking account of the universe.
Keep him well absorbed in the thought and contemplation of God in pre‐morning hours:
Ye all make him grow stronger in his monastic disposition!
Winds of these wasteland be your love!
Bokhara, Delhi, are worth no more.
Like running water Go where you will:
these desert plains are ours, and Ours are these valleys.
Honour, that high thing in a world of troubling,
Sets on the hermit’s head Darius’ crown.
How Glass is forged flint‐hard—this strange craft they tell of
Learn from some master!
Fortunes of States through individual prowess ripen
Each man one star of their ascendant:
Ocean withholds her treasure when the diver
Groping for pearlshells Clings by land’s margin.
To the Muslim freedom Gained at the price of casting off religion
Makes an ill bargain!
In our world, where once more Civilization
Looses its wild beasts, in one more encounter Spirit and flesh meet;
on the true‐believer’s Manhood God’s trust lies—
the machines of Europe Satan’s alliance.
Who knows the nation’s fates?—
but signs abound, if Muslims are wakeful.
From your buried fathers Ask pride of action;
do not fear—a king may Smile on a beggar.
THE PORTRAIT
Said the portrait to its Painter:
“My manifestation attests to Thine unbounded Skill;
And yet what a violation of justice it is that
Thou shouldst remain hid from my sight!
THE PAINTER
The vision endowed to those that observe find it oppressive:
See for thyself how the spark burnt itself out when it saw the world!
What aught is sight but sadness, gloom, feverishness and self‐torment:
Rest, or thou ignorant (of the mysteries), upon report.
THE PORTRAIT
What aught is report but the impotence of ratiocination and wisdom?
Vision is the eternal springtide of life.
The hustle and the bustle of the present age does not permit one
To express oneself melodiously.
THE PAINTER
Thou doth exist because the Perfection of My Art.
Do not, then, feel cast out in disappointment with Him that hath drawn thee.
I only put one condition if thou wishest to see Me:
Never disappear from thine own sight.
THE CORPSE (TO ITS GRAVE)
What is it, this Resurrection Day? Of what present is it the future?
0 my ancient sleeping‐chamber, What is Resurrection Day?
THE GRAVE
O corpse of a hundred years, don’t you know
That every death implies a call for resurrection?
THE CORPSE
A death that implies resurrection
Such a death does not entrap me!
It is true that I have been dead for a hundred years,
But I am not tired of this dark chamber in the earth.
The soul should once again ride the poor body
If this is resurrection, then I am not a taker!
A VOICE FROM THE UNSEEN
Death is not for snakes and scorpions, Or for birds and beasts of prey,
Eternal death is the lot of slave nations alone.
Even Israfil’s trumpet cannot bring back to life those
Whose bodies, when they lived, had no souls.
To spring back to life after death ‐only the free can do that,
Even though all living beings are headed, Into the arms of the grave.
THE GRAVE (TO ITS CORPSE)
You vicious creature! In the world you were a slave!
I had failed to understand why my soil was as hot as fire!
NAAK
Your corpse makes my darkness even darker.
It rips the earth’s veil of honour.
Beware, beware a hundred times of a slave’s corpse!
O Israfil! O Lord of the universe! O soul that is chaste and pure!
THE VOICE FROM THE UNSEEN
Resurrection upsets the order of the universe,
But it is this commotions that reveals the secrets of existence.
An earthquake makes mountains fly like clouds,
But it also starts new springs flowing in the valleys.
Total destruction must come before any re‐creation –
For in this way the problems of existence are resolved.
THE EARTH
Oh, this eternal death! Oh, this struggle that marks life!
Will this conflict in the world ever end?
Reason cannot free itself from its idols;
The commoners and the elite‐all are slaves to Lat and Manat.
How abject Adam‐ the man with divine attributes ‐has now become!
That such a world should continue to exist, Is more than heart and eye can bear.
Good luck to that King, cashiered so gracefully, whose
Dismissal shows how a ruling Power behaves!
In Britain’s fane the King is only a plaster
Image its worshippers smash whenever they choose;
Its opiate incense is for us, the slaves—
Come, English swindler, bring out our new master!
Itching palms, in the old temple of Earth, have the kneelers,
Men who remember their God only when idols are deaf.
Vain are the Hindu’s rites and vain the Mohammedan’s worship;
Wailing and gnashing of teeth still are the lot of the poor.
None of earth’s cities in truth is more than a populous desert,
High though their buildings soar, kissing the sky with their roofs.
Axe in hand Farhad toils on;—Fate’s irony witness!
Slek and content is Parvez, parching with drought in Farhad.
All that there is in that world its rulers’ brains have engendered:
Science and learning are theirs, commerce and practice of State;
Free of enslavement, Allah be thanked, to the huckster of Europe—
Free is this country of ours, scorched in the furnace of Hell.
The sun, the moon, the stars, And this azure sky all around—
Who can tell for sure all this is, The world nothingness or being!
The ideas of roads and destinations, Are fictions and myths
As life is aimless journey, indeed
Alas! Time’s hand wiped out,
That monument of the perfections Of Ahmad and Mahmood.
His sudden death signifies, The decline of knowledge and art
His, Masood’s, who was The most valuable asset
Of this caravan of ours, The indifferent cold manner of Worldly men moves me to tears,
They reckon the dawn wails of birds As lilting songs!
Please! Do not plead that The remedy of grief for a friend, Lies hidden in patience!
Please do not say that in patience lies, The solution of Death’s riddle!
A heart, howsoever loving and patient, is All the same, a stone.
And between love and patience lie A thousand miles.
Saadi
Don’t ask what is fleeting life For, who knows what means
This combine of magic and colour charm?
One born of dust must hide in dust.
But what does it mean? A short lived absence or extinction?
This man, this mere dust of path, Has been endowed with artistic taste.
Of this, Reason cannot reveal the aim.
Are the heart and vision too, The miracles of this very water and clay?
If not, what then is the end‐all of man?
The moving soul of this universe is 'There is no god but God',
Then why the Messiah, the nails and the cross?
From whom should be demanded The blood‐money of longings spilt?
For, who is the guilty and what the blood money?
Grieve not that we are In the bondage of this world,
As the heart that we have, Breaks all magic spells.
If the self lives, death is but A sojourn in life:
as love Tries death in a test of eternal life.
If the self is alive, your ocean is shoreless
And the waves of the Nile, of Euphrates are restless, separated from you.
If the self is dead, you are like a straw before the breeze,
If the self is alive, you the sultan of all existence.
If the eye is deprived of One vision of beauty exposed,
Myriad exposures of beauty Compensate for one loss.
The station of a true momin is Beyond the sky’s reach.
Below, from the earth to the Pleiades, All are idol‐houses of Lat and Manat.
His eternal abode is The sacred precinct of the One and the Only One,
Not this gloomy dusty grave Nor this exposure house of Attributes!
Those self‐aware who have Leapt above this abode of dust
Have broken the spell of The sun, the sky and the stars!
From the Emperium enquires A voice at dawn:
how did You lose your essential quality Of enquiry and understanding?
How was blunted Your scalpel of research?
Why do you not rend open The hearts of stars?
You deserve to dominate and rule over All that is visible as well as esoteric.
Can a flame be the slave of Dry sticks and grass?
Why are the sun, moon and stars not Under your suzerainty?
Why don’t heavens shudder With a mere glance from you?
True! Even to‐day blood courses Through your veins,
but Your thoughts do not inspire, Nor is your thinking fearless.
An eye which in its vision, Does not imbibe pure virtue
Is capable of seeing, no doubt, But is not all‐seeing.
Not a bit remains in you Of your clear reflection of conscience!
Alas! O you victim of imperialism, Of mullah‐ism and mysticism!
What fruit will the bough of my hope bear–
What do I know of your destiny?
The rose‐bud needs to open today–
Why wait for tomorrow’s morning breeze?
Set him free of this world’s affairs
To be free of casting for everyone snares.
In old age, Satan’s thoughts too are old
Wherefrom should he bring new sins’ flares?
Upset this world of morn and eve,
Of these wetlands, of those dry leave.
May your Godhead remain free of blemish all
In my insipid prostrations do not believe!
My poor estate makes proud men covetous,
Poverty such as mine ennobles us.
Beware those other rags and begging‐bowls
That make the Muslim pusillanimous!
Rescue me please from wisdom’s narrowness
And from excessive light, its plentifulness.
It deigns to cast looks at others, that is,
The eye of Muslims’ shamelessness!
Iqbal said to the Shaykh of the Ka‘bah:
‘Who went to sleep under the very arch in the mosque?’
A voice sounded from the walls of the mosque:
‘Who became lost in the idol‐house of the West?’
The old flame of desires has grown cold,
As the Muslims’ veins hot‐blood no longer hold.
Greetings to the idols for my secularism,
For flame of Allah Hoo’s cheers is dead, behold!
The talk of Muslim is interesting, His heart warm,
breath light and gaze arresting.
O who can catch a glimpse of him, for he,
Though the very soul of company, is by himself resting!
The clairvoyance of the zephyr
Is apparent from its discrimination between flowers and thorns!
A flower cannot be guarded
If the thorn has the nature of silk.
Of love and losing what words need be said?
The self’s unfolding is Life’s fountain‐head;
There’s neither loss to ocean nor to pearl
In the pearl’s loosening from the ocean’s bed.
Why is there no storm in your sea?
Why is your khudi not Muslim?
It is pointless to complain of God’s decree –
Why are you not God’s decree?
If with the heart’s eye the intellect would see aright
This universe is illuminated with Allah’s light.
But if you see through the waxing sun and moon,
It is just the revolution of morn and night.
Sometimes by rising from the ocean like a wave,
Occasionally like a diver in its bosom behave.
At times cross beyond the ocean’s shore
To expose better your self’s real enclave.
Your springs and lakes with water pulsating and quivering like quicksilver,
the morning birds fluttering about the sky, agitated and in turmoil,
O Valley of Laulab!
When the pulpit and the niche cease to re‐create Resurrections,
faith then is dead or a mere dream, for thee, me and for all.
O Valley of Laulab!

O Valley of Laulab!
The Mullah’s sight has lost the light of penetrative discernment;
the mystic’s wine, pure and sparkling, no longer produces frenzy,
O Valley of Laulab!
A dervish whose morning lamentation
may awaken the hearts of the people is no longer around,
Harder than death is what thou call’st slavery,
would that slaves understand master’s tricks;
strange are the ways of imperialists:
they allow the sounding of trumpet; but forbid resurrection.
Thy soul is weary under the stress of slavery,
build niche for khudi in thy impassive breast.
Today that land of Kashmir, under the heels of the enemy, has become weak, helpless and poor—
once known among the wise as Little Iran.
When the man of truth is overawed by the power and pomp of king and landlord,
a cry of burning lament issues forth from the heavens.
The old farmer’s cottage, on the mountainside, where pain and grief ever rule—
tells its sad story of Fate’s hard lot.
So skilful of hands, so rich in mind, these people, alas, or pure breed,
O God, your justice, so long delayed, must come at last as a retribution.
When the enslaved people’s rage boils and they rise in revolt against the master,
this world of near and far, of colour and smell, becomes the scene of tremors and convulsions.
It purifies man’s conscience—eschewing all doubts and misgivings—
When the lamp of high ideals is lit, brightening all paths leading to the goal.
There are old maladies and ancients scars the people suffer from, that intellect fails to cure and heal,
but love shows its skill and without the help of physician’s talents removes all scars and cures all woes.
The master’s sturdy body—with a heart of stone and face of a mirror—
gets soon smashed up and beaten down at the repeated blows of the weak slave.
The partridge flies with the majesty of the falcons;
the hunter is nonplussed: is it a partridge or a falcon?
Every nation is astir, her thoughts in a constant flux;
today we see in the East the signs of tomorrow’s resurrection.
The deadbody, awaiting Israfil’s Call, has all of a sudden risen to life:
Nature’s pitiless laws work wonders.
The dissolute know the Sufi’s accomplishments,
though their miracles are not so well‐known.
Self‐enrichment, self‐respect and the cry of Ana‐al‐Haq—
these are the states of the wayfarer, if he be free;
but if slave, then it all becomes his all is He;
he is dead body, grave and sudden death, all in one.
Come out of the monastery and play the role of Shabbir,
for monastery’s faqr is but grief and affliction.
Thy religion and literature both smell of renunciation:
symbol of old age of dying nations.
Imperialism has myriads of Satans with eyes full of magic charms
that evoke among the prey an irresistible urge to be its victim.
How carelessly they passed by, with no ear to my lamentations,
The Kashmiri’s black eyes, so lacking in lustre and life, who made them so dead and mute?
Thou think’st it a mere drop of blood; well,
manʹs heart is but lofty ambitions.
The revolutions of moon and stars are not to its liking:
It makes its own nights and days.
The earth that enshrines in its bosom the fire of plane tree:
this exalted earth can never be dead and cold.
When flowers’ bookshop opened in the garden
Mullah’s bookish knowledge lost all value.
The spring breeze was exhilarating, poise‐breaking,
the old man of Indrab burst into ghazal‐singing.
The tulip, of fiery skirt, said:
it doth reveal the secrets of the soul.
Who calls sleep awhile in the grave as eternal death,
sows seeds of destruction in the earth.
Life is not a succession of days and nights,
nor is it intoxication and dreamy sleep;
life is to burn in one’s fire:
happy is the man who grasps this truth.
If thou snatch’st a spark from heart’s fire,
thou canst be a sun under the sky.
A free man’s vein is hard like stone’s,
a slave’s is tender like vine’s;
a slave’s heart is dead, frustrated and never sees the light of hope;
a free man’s heart is alive, full of zest and happiness.
A free man’s wealth, a shining heart and warm breath,
that of slave, only moist eyes.
The slave lacks sincerity and generosity
though he be adept in argumentation.
And never the twine shall be equal,
the one is slave to fate, the other, master of fate.
All high and low are unaware of khudi:
is it a mosque or tavern?
The head preacher has withheld this secret from us:
the Harem itself is the moth moving round Harem’s lamp.
Faith and kufr, only talisman of ignorance,
talking of Shaykh and Brahman is all myth;
O God, may the valley have a dervish
whose faqr works Moses‐like;
how long would they remain hidden from the world?
the unique gems that the Wooler Lake has in its depth.
The living nations of the world have won their laurels,
the world transformed through the dynamism of their acts;
the astrologer’s calendar of the future is false,
the old stars have fallen away.
The world’s heart is so fiery
that river waves shoot out stars.
The earth is experiencing tremors after tremors,
the warnings of Nature are but too clear.
Khidr, standing by the Wooler, is thinking:
When will the Himalayas’ springs burst forth?
It is the sign of living nations
their fate changes day and night;
their life is sincerity and generosity to perfection,
Nature too forgives their follies;
in manners qalandar‐like, in majesty as Iskander:
these people are like naked swords.
Beauty and majesty of a self‐conscious man flows from khudi:
it is the text, the rest are commentaries.
I don’t deny the splendour of the days of ‘Id,
but alas! only the takbirs of free men are acceptable to God.
What can the sage know my songs’ secret?
the words of man of madness are beyond reason’s ken.
How heretically do you play the game of life?
you adjust yourself to times, rather than to thine self.
I no longer see in the schools
heart of Junaid and insight of Ghazali and Razi.
Nature—the great lawgiver—decrees:
the ways of falcon are forbidden in the religion of sparrows.
The same heavenly law‐giver decreed for the male falcon:
fly about the skies, don’t deal with the earth.
I have not left speaking the naked truth,
though the people may speak ill of me before the kings.
We have neither Samarkand nor Bukhara to offer,
the dervish can only pray for the Shirazi Turk.
The ways of the West are calculating, the ways of the East are monkish;
there the times change from moment to moment, here the times see no change whatsoever.
Khidr, on the bank of the river, spoke to me thus in confidence:
all are the ways of sorcery, be the actor a king of dervish.
These people of the monasteries look upon me as their rival;
they fear lest my beautiful songs rent asunder the saint’s threshold stone.
This is the manifest symbol of the knowledge of the slave people:
What if the earth has limits! the whole expanse of Space is boundless.
I can’t see what it is: is it self‐deception of deception of God?
Having invented the excuse of fate, the Muslim has ceased to act meaningfully.
The rose twig made the hunter weep on seeing me caught in the net:
a charming sweet singer was he, his nest rested harmlessly on my branches.
O land of charming and sweet flowers what need is there to explain:
the burning red tulip, grief‐stricken and sad, best reflects our bloody heart.
The gods of Himalayas speak thus to thee, to me and to all:
Fate is a name we give to the retribution of what we do and act.
In the bitter winds of winter, the poor labourer works in a naked body,
though his skill provides shawls to the rich.
The world shall never be loyal to thee:
it is and has been ever in flux.
Self‐awareness has made the mujahid forget his body,
to whom bearing of coat‐of‐mail is forbidden.
Nourish that lofty will and burning heart,
get back your father’s arms if thou wish’st to have his sword.
I am quiet a stranger to the town, listen to my bewailings;
may thy breast entertain many a resurrection!
The grief‐laden songs of mine are valuable:
the unsatisfied heart is a wealth most uncommon.
I fear the world does not appreciate my labour,
it isn’t like Farhad’s:
The axe’s noise falling on the stone is something else,
Beware, it is voice of axe falling on the heart.
It was God’s command that the pomp of Parviz
Be given to the qalandar, for he has angelic attributes.
I was told: Take it and be an emperor;
Confer permanence on the ephemeral with your talent.
I would have much honoured this trust—
All bitterness tastes sweet to the mouth of a dervish.
However, the self‐respect of faqr could not accept it
When He said: this is the charity of my Godhead.
The Ajamites do not yet know, The fine points of our faith;
Otherwise, Husain Ahmad of Deoband! What is this foolhardiness?
A sermon‐song from the pulpit that, A nation by a homeland be!
From the real position, Of the Arabian Prophet, How sadly unaware is he!
Your self merge with Mustafa, For all faith embodies in him!
If you do not reach up to him, It is all Bu Lahab’s idolatry!
To know and see is so easy in the world.
Nothing may stay hidden for this universe is luminous.
The Nature’s veil is translucent if one is willing to see:
Far too visible are the angel’s faint smiles.
This world is an invitation for the human being to look,
For every secret is given an instinct to jump out of its closet.
It is the tears of human blood that the Almighty has used
For stirring up storms in His oceans.
What would the sky know whose abode is this earthy planet;
On whose nightly banquets do the stars stand in watch!
If I am the end of all, then what lies beyond?
Where lies the limit of my unending adventures?
