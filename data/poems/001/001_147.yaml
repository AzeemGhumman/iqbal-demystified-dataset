  'text': 'Mullah Muhammad Malik Quma (d. 1615) came from Qum, Iran to Ahmad Nagar in South India in 1549 where he was patronized by Murtaza Niïam, Nizam Shah I. Later he moved to Bijapur and lived under the patronage of Ibraham ‘Adil Shah. He was one of the eminent Persian poets of his time. In addition to the inclusion of one verse in the last two verses of this poem ‘Allamah Iqbal has alluded to this verse in Rumuz-i-Bekhudi also. Mullah ‘Abd al-Qadir Badayuni also has praised this verse in his book Muntakhib al-Tawarakh. | This poem is the exposition of ‘Allamah Iqbal’s views on Western education. Though the educational philosophy of ‘Allamah Iqbal is a vast subject and much has been written about it, its essence is that education should produce Khuda and the desire as well as the ability to struggle in the cause of God and Truth. Though the subject cannot be explained in all its dimensions in this translation some comprehension is essential to do justice to the poem. Western education may be beneficial to the Western people and may have been necessary for the material advancement of Indian Muslims in their special circumstances created by the British rule in the sub-continent it is detrimental to the ideals and goals of Islam as set out in the Holy Qur’an. Establishment of the “Kingdom of God on earth” in the form of the super-national Islamic State, with all its details and accompaniments, is the purpose of the mission of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.), which was entrusted by him to his Ummah at the time of the last pilgrimage. The Holy Qur’an is replete with commands to this effect, reference to which has been made in previous poems, for example the introduction to Poem 84. Taranah-i-Milla (The National Anthem of Muslims). When viewed against this background Western education not only falls short of the needs of Muslims but is contrary to them. Being secular and materialistic it is in fact detrimental to Muslims’ aspirations and objectives. A small sample of quotations from some other poems of ‘Allamah Iqbal is given below to give some indication of his views on the subject: | (209) The school and tavern teach only not to be | Learn to be that you may be and want to be | (210) O God ! My complaints are against the schools’ lords | They are teaching mud-slinging to falcon’s fledglings | (211) I would not get that knowledge and wisdom for a piece of straw | Which acquaints not the ghaza with the battle-field | It appears necessary to explain here that ‘Allamah Iqbal was not opposed to all Western education. When Sir Saiyyid Ahmad Khan and his colleagues started their campaign to persuade Indian sub-continent’s Muslims to acquire Western education they had scientific and technical education foremost in mind. ‘Allamah Iqbal had the same opinion and has repeatedly emphasized the importance of science and technology for material betterment. Cf. | (212) West’s strength is in science and technology | With help of this same fire its lamp is lighted | The deleterious effects of Western education have resulted mainly from the philosophy of science and from humanities. The former has created a disbelief in the existence of a non-tangible spiritual universe, and has created belief in the mechanistic and a-rational concept of creation and operation of the material universe. This is opposed to the Qur’anic concept according to which the material universe has been created by God instead of coming into existence by accident. It has been created with a purpose and not whimsically or in sport. It also states that the material universe in not eternal and will also end in its present form. The Holy Qur’an is replete with this message which emphasizes its importance, e.g. 3:191; 15:85; 16:3; 21:16-17; 39:5; 44:39; 45:22; and 46:73. The Holy Qur’an also teaches us that God has not rested or retired after creating the universe but is actively directing its affairs. Denial of this concept deprives Man of faith in the life Hereafter and the accountability for one’s deeds on earth. This deprivation leads to the cardinal vice of materialism according to which this world and life in it is the be-all and end-all of existence. This inculcates jealousy and greed for acquiring material wealth and arrogance when it has been acquired. This triple-headed monster of jealousy, greed and arrogance brings out a plethora of vices out of the Pandora’s box. One has to look around himself in the present day world to appreciate the truth of this. The whole of the modern world has been plunged into the vortex of a moral and spiritual storm which has destroyed all humane values. The cure lies in reverting to the spiritual values taught by the Holy Qur’an. | The following small sample is presented to reflect ‘Allamah Iqbal’s thought about the deprivation of the Western education from the higher concepts of existence: | (213) They conceal the higher motives from the human eye | Put the soul to sleep and awaken the material eye! | (214) The West dark with the smoke of machines is | This Valley of Aiman unwortly of Effulgence is'
