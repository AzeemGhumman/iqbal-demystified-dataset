## Source
Major source of the data is [Iqbal Academy Pakistan](http://iap.gov.pk/) website.

Other than that, hundreds of _Iqbal Demystified Android App Users_ have helped us by reporting typos that we fixed in the dataset.

A lot of poem introductions are also contributed by our App users.

## Intent
This repository serves as the source of truth for our projects that use this data. Although Iqbal's corpus is available on other websites, we could not find a website that organizes this data in such a way that it can be programmatically used by an application. Our projects that use this repository will incorporate the most recent files from this repository at regular intervals.

Currently, we have 2 projects that use this data:
* [Iqbal Demystified Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vanity.iqbal&hl=en_US)
    
    We recently made this an open-souce project.

* Iqbal Demystified Web Client

We also encourage researchers and hobbyists to use this dataset for their projects. The **developers** folder contains more information about the YAML defination.

## Contribute
We need everyone's help to make sure that the contents of this repository are accurate. We expect users to report typos and broken audio links, write Introductions to poems in different languages, add notes to poems that they think will help others. Also, please suggests improvements to this project.
