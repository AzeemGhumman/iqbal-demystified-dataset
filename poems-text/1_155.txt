شب معراج
*
اختر شام کي آتي ہے فلک سے آواز
سجدہ کرتي ہے سحر جس کو، وہ ہے آج کي رات
رہ يک گام ہے ہمت کے ليے عرش بريں
کہہ رہي ہے يہ مسلمان سے معراج کي رات

THE NIGHT OF THE CELESTIAL ASCENSION OF THE HOLY PROPHET S.A.W.
*
This short but beautiful poem, eulogizing the night of Mi‘raj portrays the spontaneous feelings of ‘Allamah Iqbal after reading the Holy Qur’an Surah 17. The significance of this night is two fold. First, it was the occasion when the secrets of the spiritual part of the celestial world were opened to a human being. This shows the elegant position of Man in comparison with other creatures of God. Secondly, the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.) was the only person in the history of mankind and that of divine revelation to whom these secrets were visually shown. The first fact is expressed by ‘Allamah Iqbal in another verse, which says:

(216) I have learnt from the Holy Prophet’s Ascension to the celestial world
That the world of Man transcends the celestial world

The second one shows that the disclosure of spiritual secrets of the celestial world completed the process of their revelation and obviated the need for subsequent prophets. This is another proof in support of the finality of the Prophethood with the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.).

This call of the evening star is coming from the sky
“This is the night before which the dawn prostrates

“For courage the ‘Arsh-i-Baran is only a pace away”
The Mi‘raj’s night is saying this to the Muslim

Akhtar-e-Shaam Ki Ati Hai Falak Se Awaz

Sajda Karti Hai Sahar Jis Ko, Woh Hai Aaj Ki Raat

Reh-e-Yak Gaam Hai Himmat Ke Liye Arsh-e-Bareen

Keh Rahi Hai Ye Musalman Se Meeraj Ki Raat
