So wan and puzzled though, is yet at sea. $1

1.         An other Persian poet says in this context: [An outcast is there was written on Slate, They took it to others none knew his fate, Where is that Confidant "O God! whom thence, We say that he heard and rapped out hence".]

2.         At sea far off puzzled as he knows not the truth. Haq; A Holy name and attribute of God means Truth. Slate; the guarded slate in Heavens on which everything is written.
