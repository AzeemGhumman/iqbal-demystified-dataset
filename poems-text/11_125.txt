I have been born in a flameless $1 age,
In me nature kept a fire ablaze.

1.         In line 1, Iqbal has used the word 'flameless' age in a metaphorical sense. It, however, means faithless.

2.         Iqbal says Say they are dragging me on cross, (is the literal translation) viz, to kill me. Here he is asking the Prophet to tell this state to God as a passionate appeal of a lover.
